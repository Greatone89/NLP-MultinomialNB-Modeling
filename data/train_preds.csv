"do any kind of thoughts make you a bad person? we all know that  thoughts do not determine if you're a bad person. they're not something you can control, they're unwanted etc.  so my question is do any thoughts make you a bad person? regardless of whether they're  or not?   like let's say there's two people. they both commit the same actions. neither of them hurt anybody. however person 1 always has horrible, disgusting thoughts, questions in their mind etc. are they both an equal amount of a good person?   i'm starting to worry because my  thoughts have started to not feel  anymore. like i remember when i first started having them i would visibly recoil, sometimes even gag out of disgust, or feel like wanting to cry. but now i've become so used to them that it's like they have no effect on me.   i don't feel a strong emotional reaction towards disgusting thoughts, and i feel like this makes me a bad person. it makes the thoughts feel like not even as bad as they would have originally sounded which i know is awful. i feel terrible. i feel like i'm deceiving my loved ones.  i'm starting sophomore year after summer and i don't know what to do:(",0,0

"""you are trans"" or ""i'm trans"" etc. please read post i want to preface this post by saying please do not comment with anything like ""sounds like you're in denial"" or ""uh yeah you are because cis people don't have thoughts like that."" i have struggled with  thoughts for years, and this only the latest one. i have also seriously weighed this issue, and have ultimately decided that i enjoy being a man, and i have no desire to be or become trans. there is no evidence of past behavior that would suggest it, and when i really think about it, i would hate to be trans. due to the nature of how being trans is treated on the internet, it seems like any indication, thought, or action, no matter how trivial, can be evidence that one is trans and they just ""haven't realized it yet."" the nature of that argument alone makes these thoughts terrible to fight off, as denying them or reaffirming my gender just strengthens them. there is no recourse.   the origin of these thoughts can be traced back to a singular moment, earlier this year, where i was playing a song i wrote for a friend. the friend pointed out my use of the pronoun ""her"" and insinuated that it sounds like something a trans person still in the closet would right. the song was written about a person i knew in real life, let's call her louise, a singer-songwriter who would spend her days busking on street corners. however, even though i initially brushed off the comment, it began to eat at me in the back of my mind. was this the echoing of my subconscious, did i truly intend that interpretation without even realizing? after giving it some thought, i decided i didn't, and it was a simple oversight on my part on how the song could be interpreted. but the thoughts continued, and began to scare me. i started responding to them (horrible mistake), which only made them more frequent.  it has been 3-5 months now, and i still struggle with this every day. i can't reason it away, i can't let them pass without responding to it because i'm terrified to, i have to respond. sometimes the back and forth gets so bad i have to audibly shout ""no im not"" to get them to stop. i was looking into trying meditation, but it says that you're supposed to ""observe thoughts without emotion, and let them drift away."" i fear that if i do this the thoughts will consume me and i'll ultimately decide that i am, even thought i know that i'm not. so i'm stuck. it's debilitating. what do i do? should i let the thoughts wash over me in mediation? that sounds terrifying....  let me reiterate do not affirm my  thoughts or insinuate they carry some weight, this is not an ""egg"" issue, this in an  thoughts issue.",0,0

"i have no respect for myself tw: kind of self-harm / sl*t-shaming  i want to cry so much. i was in an app looking for some clothes and i saw a video of a girl with this kind of top that is open in the middle, so you can see the center of her upper body and a bit of her chest.  then i have this thought: ""isn't that too much?"" i think first, then ""isn't she provoking, isn't she a sl*t?""  my reaction? getting angry at myself and saying ""how can you say that, you b/tc-"" and then i slap myself kinda hard in the cheek.  i felt horrible for that thought, for not respecting her body and her decisions. ""why do i have to think that about this girl? if she's not doing anything fucking wrong, is she hurting anyone? no. then why doesn't anyone have to criticize her or call her a ""sl-t"" for wearing whatever she likes, huh?!""  and i feel terrible both for ""thinking"" that (in quotes cause i don't know if it's me or my  thoughts anymore) about that poor girl and for the slap. in the end that's self-h/rm and i feel like i've normalised it a lot, because i think i'm a monster, because i think i deserve it. because i think i'm never going to change cause i ""don't want to"" and that i deserve to be punished for so...  i'm trying not to find reassurance, but to get any advice on self-love and self-confidence. i feel there's some part of me that truly didn't understand the concept of wearing x clothes maybe due to internalised misogyny, but i also feel like whenever i want to admit it or any sort of mistake, my brain just goes ""no, you had to respect that person from the very beginning, you're a monster. now suffer"". basically it's a mixed of ocd and pure perfectionism (you have to know everything, otherwise it means you were having ""typical bad person thoughts"" in first place). it's like... i can't stand thinking something wrong (unfair) about anybody or anything, even if it wasn't my choice to have that idea since i probably indirectly learnt it...  if anyone relates to this sort of thoughts, please don't hesitate to share it. it would be really helpful for me. thank youüíú",0,0

" thoughts about false events. hey guys.  just wanted some advise about something and wonder if anyone else does this.  do you ever recall an event that wasn‚Äôt even bad, and change the outcome of that event to make it a horrible one.  basically saying what could of happened and then your mind runs on that event you created by simply saying what if.  the guilt you feel, the shame you feel, and the feeling of what you could have lost.  i‚Äôm a father and husband and couldn‚Äôt imagine life without the loves of my life.  i really can‚Äôt.  i cry just the thought of something happening to them.  which is where my ocd attacks all the time.  many themes of ocd over the years.  it‚Äôs a living hell.  i manage for the most part.  but my mind always goes back to past events and says what if.  latest one was what if i drank and fell asleep at the wheel.  killed someone and got a dui manslaughter.  being in prison and having my wife and son come visit very little.   will they wait for me.  these kind of thoughts constantly run man.  i don‚Äôt even drink.  been sober 10 years now.  but my mind creates these scenarios and i constantly ruminate on them.  it breaks my heart because it makes me feel like i put our lives at risk.  i have had  thoughts my entire life.  when my son was born four years ago is when i was told about  thoughts.  i did feel better but they attack once in a while from time to time.  i keep telling myself everything is fine.  i‚Äôm not in prison.  things are going well actually.  ocd and anxiety just keeps going.   does anyone else change events and create consequences from those events.  i‚Äôd love to hear about your story and how you deal with them.   thanks guys.",0,0

"curse and a companion? and trigger warning. despite the negative connotation, i find it quite comforting at times. i always felt disgusted by the temptation of my brain for its unruly and sexual desires. and as i have regained control of my thoughts i will flick my head as if i was flicking the person to whom when i was unethical.  when stress mounts, the  thoughts will come and comfort me. sometimes even speaking toward me, trying to reason with and also convinces me of following their path to a fulfilling life. there are two as i have known, one who is moral while the other who is aggressive. the moral person will try to speak to me about the path of morality and ethic. to abide by rules which will break my stubbornness in accommodating societal standards. although many times i tried heeding her advice, it never work because of the incompatibility of personality. the aggressive person will try to convince me to be more aggressive and dominant, although he has a lustful streak. likewise, i try going along with him but that doesn't work out.  i will at times have conversations with them as if they were real people. so much so that optimism comes when both of them try to cheer me up when i am down, as if reviving me from my downfall. sometimes i even feel that they are true companions or the fact that i am trying to falsely believe that they will only be the one that truly understands me. i couldn't trust others with my true feelings, after all, i have them. however, they may argue with each other and also agree, but that does not mean that i will agree with any of them.   i've asked others about my situation, which i recently just found out and realise what my  thoughts were doing. none, or only one, could relate to what i am experiencing.  i've been trying to find out where this comes from. why i am having these  thoughts. with my bad memory, i think i have found one of my earliest memory where it might have come from.   tw after this, i think.  so i shall begin that this is my fault. i was a gaming addict. i didn't care about my studies and would lie my way out just to play some more games. however, when i was 13, there was a month when i am in a constant bad relationship with my parents. stress mounts for my need to play games while my parents disagree about it.  one day my parents asked me to go study and not play games. of course, i abide deceivingly by locking the door and placing a textbook on my lap while playing my game. after some time i hear knockings on the door. i quickly place the phone away and open the door. my father was suspicious and quickly asked for my phone. he hold on to it and knew right away that i was playing games because it was hot. then, he was screaming in anger, scolding me harshly. let me remind you that the stress between my parents and me had been piling up for weeks, it's a no-brainer they will respond as such. however, suddenly, i felt scared of what my father might do due to his erratic body language. i took that as an aggressive stance. i was like a dog back in the corner with his tail between his legs. the moment my father approached me with that aggressive stomp, my brain was ringing with alarm that this was a huge life-threatening threat.   the moment he grabbed my hand i felt like i just lost control of my body. as if the instincts have taken control like i was just an observer of my own body. the religious would say a demon has possessed me. i punched my dad in the face a few times, knowing clearly that i intend to shut down the threat. however, it all felt peaceful, as in quiet. the short moment felt long yet tranquil. i'm not sure if i'm there, but i felt like i was another person. until i suddenly realised what i was doing and gained control, with someone else screaming within me. i felt like there were three people within me, one who was aggressive and the one who screams, my moral counterpart. i was left in disbelief that i did it, even today. i never felt i was in control and out of the characteristics of my behaviour. afterwards, i was always left with the belief it wasn't me that did it, it was somebody else. but clearly, i am trying to avoid the blame and i couldn't accept it. however, the feeling that i felt was so real, that i couldn't deny it. so i am left with this ambiguous feeling.   these  thoughts could just very well be the scars from the past or due to hiding my true persona with masks upon masks. i will never know. but i will continue unravelling myself to understand my thoughts better.",0,0

" thoughts while masturbating i have been having  thoughts for a long time. i had only recently started being able to cope with the guilt and shame. i thought i was finally getting over it. but now i've been having  mental images pop up while engaging in self pleasure. really disgusting things that i don't want to think about like family members, young people, etc.      the first time it happened it happened right at climax, a mental image of it popped up. i immediately stopped. because i stopped the orgasm was completely ruined. but i felt satisfied and reaffirmed afterward. ""i'm not a bad person, i sacrificed my pleasure just so i wouldnt accidentally have a mental image like that while climaxing""      but it kept happening and i started getting frustrated with the ruined orgasms. so i tried to come up with a way to make it stop. i remember back a year ago when it first started happening i would just continue while the mental image was happening during climax. after a while, it genuinely worked and stopped happening.      so i tried that last night, i ignored the mental images and climaxed. but i just felt so guilty and disgusted afterward. i feel so sick and i don't know what to do.      i was never getting off to the images, i was just imagining scenerios with my boyfriend. all i wanted was some self pleasure after being stressed for so long. and now i feel utterly horrible.      has anybody else experienced this? any tips and advice on how to get rid of it?",0,0

"i‚Äôve been having  thoughts for over a year now i‚Äôm female 12 (ik i shouldn‚Äôt be here) but i have  thoughts, and it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ really bad. most of them are either extremely suspicious, walking beyond other peoples boundaries, a massacre happening near my area/people dying, or just something completely illegal. i deal with these daily, they‚Äôre getting a little better, yes. but they keep going on and i just have to just. get this off my chest.  firstly, i want to say my ‚Äúdeath wish‚Äù thoughts. every time i‚Äôm having a good time or watch scary things that have to do with death or other morbid things, my mind will always be like ‚Äúi hope [blank] happens to [person]‚Äù or somebody in trouble/in the hospital/ life or death situation. heck, it might not even be people in trouble, literally anyone. the same thoughts reply just praying to lord something bad will happen to some random strangers on the street and it just pisses me off. my mind won‚Äôt only wish death upon others, but me too! every time i walk on the street, my mind says: ‚Äúi wish [blank] will happen to you‚Äù or ‚Äúi hope [random stranger] will [blank] you‚Äù. the worst part is, i fear that god will actually listen and make it happen, and i try with my life to suppress them so god doesn‚Äôt listen.  my ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù thoughts  if you know what i mean by ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù then you already know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ this one is really awkward, it just. ew‚Ä¶ you can see where this is going. it just ‚Ä¶ com- nope!!! just. digital footprint!!!!  i have religious  thoughts as well but it barely happens  now‚Ä¶ you guys must be wondering: well what the heck must these thoughts started from. these thoughts could actually go from 2018 - 2019 actually. but those thoughts weren‚Äôt as intense as they are now. i also had  thoughts about one of my fav youtubers in 2020. but it went away months later. where it actually started getting bad was in late 2021, but it all started  in april 2021.. i loved this mod called ‚Äúdave and bambi‚Äù but it atrociously took a mad turn after my mind said the characters are ‚Äúgod‚Äú and such. when they‚Äôre not, well, bambi is, but in the game (it‚Äôs canon) but nobody will legitimately believe he‚Äôs god‚Ä¶ right? well‚Ä¶. my mind did, but not me. it also told me a bunch of //other// people are god but like‚Ä¶ why? it also told me to ‚Äúconvert to another religon‚Äù or such. very annoying as you can see.  there‚Äôs people on this sub saying that disabled people are more likely to get these thoughts than anyone else. which i think i am since my mum‚Äôs new iep copy for me in the future said i was diagnosed with adhd multiple times. i also had found an autism diagnosis from district something (i don‚Äôt think i should say..). it‚Äôs from seven years ago (2015) but i‚Äôm not sure cos they‚Äôre going to give me evaluation for it in months. but since i have a lot of evaluations coming and the autism one is last. expect no update for a while. i have a fear of lying to you guys just in case i‚Äôm not mentally handicapped but i just want to mention this extra information.  just a side note that if you‚Äôre suffering from these thoughts a lot here are some tips:  if your thoughts aren‚Äôt praying to god you should just ignore it. i know it‚Äôs a hard pill to swallow but ignoring these thoughts can make a difference. you already know these thoughts aren‚Äôt okay and you could never support them or listen to them. so just ignore them, take a sip of coffee or tea (if you don‚Äôt like coffee) or water if you don‚Äôt like neither. and no, you aren‚Äôt acceptable of these thoughts in any way if you just let them in there. they‚Äôll go away the more you ignore it. watch your favorite show or hang out with your friends! it‚Äôll go away. very soon.",0,0

"how do you manage your  thoughts? hi. i'm new to this sub and i suffer from what i believe is  thoughts. they negatively impact my waking life and my dream life.   what are my  thoughts like? i have many types that go though my mind. when i'm around knives , i think to myself , what if i just picked this up and stabbed whoever was around me?  when i'm in public settings surrounded by people of different races than me , i often think to myself what if i yelled out a racial slur? i'm not racist at all though.   when my kids were little i would have thoughts about hurting them , not that i ever would and i never did. i love my kids with everything in me.   when i'm on quiet places , i legit get the urge to scream at the top of my lungs.   last night in a dream or what some would call an astral projection experience, i called a celebrity a racial slur in my mind and he heard me , i felt terrible!  i also have  thoughts and in my mind i come up with really morbid , evil jokes that are related to situations i either read about , am going through or things that other people are going through. even though some people with dark sense of humor would find them funny if i shared them, i never find them funny and i hate when i come up with them.  i've only shared my problem about having  thoughts with two people in my life , but never went into detail about any of them.   it sometimes feels like i have touretts, but in my mind and luckily not vocal.   how do you deal with your  thoughts? do they have medication for  thoughts? is having  thoughts related to any type of mental illness or is it considered a mental illness alone? is it recognized in the mental health world?  sorry if these questions have been asked before! thanks for reading! :)",0,0

"animals warning: talk of beastiality and nsfw content i want to start off by saying if this is the wrong place to post about this i‚Äôll take it down immediately. i‚Äôm quite ashamed about how this happened but i will be describing my expierences in full detail.   yesterday i was browsing an audio porn website and came across a post that was just tagged with ""beast"". i didn‚Äôt fully understand. curiosity got the best of me and i clicked on it. i had never heard of beastiality like this before. or thought about it for that matter. i was quite confused. they just dropped their desire to do that so plainly, along with a bunch of other things. i didn‚Äôt understand how someone could be so blunt about that. i ended up listening to another post of his about that. i could hardly understand what he meant in the other, so i thought this would help. i was genuinely very shocked. i ended up looking up things like ""why is beastiality real?"", ""is beastiality legal?"", and anything related really. i ended up coming across posts of people describing their experiences, desires, and hatred for these acts. it seems to be completely illegal. i‚Äôll revisit this later. i tried to move on. i was still struggling with these thoughts. i ended up listening to another audio about this. at this point, i'm not sure why i did that. i don't know if i was trying to understand, look for a rational solution to this or if i was aroused. i‚Äôm very ashamed to type that out. i didn‚Äôt end up finishing it and just cried and thought about this more for a bit. fast forward to later, i go on an app to talk with people. to my surprise, someone had a lewd joke about their dog in their bio. i wanted to confront them about it, only to realize i had forgotten how to spell beastiality. i ended up looking the word up to confirm and going back to the app to talk. later, when i opened the google app, i see i had accidently clicked on a porn website for this. i immediately clicked off once it hit me what i was looking at. i was shocked and disgusted. i promised myself i wouldn't seek out any of this real content. even if it wasn't intentional, i still feel like a depraved person for seeing that. when i did hit the back button to get off that website, i saw it was the first thing to come up under the definition. i'm so upset by this. when i was researching this earlier, it seemed to be illegal in my area. why is this so accessible when most places in the united states prohibit beastiality? i looked for some people speaking of similar experiences, but i haven‚Äôt really found anything. i‚Äôm not sure if this even counts as  thoughts. i feel like a sick person. i decided to sleep on it. now here i am skipping class to write this out. i can't get these images or thoughts out of my head, and they're distressing me. it was hard enough for me to accept that having  thoughts didn't make me a bad person. this is new to me since i feel i have put these thoughts into action.   sorry for my poor writing. thanks for reading.",0,0

"religion exists on the argand plane so, one day when i was not able to sleep, a weird thought came into my mind, what if there is a norm to tell how religious/non-religious a person is.  presenting you religious protractor- the religion plane (like an argand plane) is a graph whose x-axis represents atheism and the y-axis represents the religiousness of the person.  for those who don't know what argand plane is, here's the wikipedia definition.  **argand plane** \- the complex plane is the plane formed by the complex numbers, with a cartesian coordinate system such that the x-axis, called the real axis, is formed by the real numbers, and the y-axis, called the imaginary axis, is formed by the imaginary numbers.  &#x200b;  **why did i choose the argand plane?**  because i believe, you all can disagree with me, that religion is a social construct and it is somewhat imaginary. the only reason that religion is not considered delusional is becasue it‚Äôs common among the people.  anywhooo getting back to the graph.  **max scale** 100 - maximum extent for being religious / non-religious  so if i say i'm 50+20r (r is the iota of this plane). i'm 50% atheist and 20% religious and i think this is the better way to express yourself because there's more information on each component.  the problem with this graph is that some point doesn't exist like 100+100r, the person can't be extremely religious and also an extreme atheist at the same time.  &#x200b;  now what the 4 quadrant represents  **1st quadrant:**  (x+yr)  any points except 100+100r exist.  **2nd quadrant:** (-x+yr)  in this quadrant, the person can be religious but hates atheism because it is on the left side of the y-axis.  **3rd quadrant:**  (-x-yr)  this is the only quadrant that i'm not sure of what it represents because both the parameters are negative. the problem is when the person is not religious it automatically means he/she is an atheist, this statement creates a problem because according to the quadrant the person is not religious and not an atheist too which is absurd.  so what does a person follows if he/she is not religious and atheist at the same time?  after thinking about it for a few minutes,  i came up with another theory that this type of person follows some weird ""cult"" or a ""person"" or a ""group"" or does an activity. they don't give two shits about religion or atheism.  **4th quadrant:**  (x-yr)  in this quadrant, the person can be an atheist but hates religion because it is on the negative side of the y-axis.   next time when someone asks whether you believe in religion or not, just tell them your coordinates :)  *\~stgs*",0,0

"i've started having  thoughts about the sun im not exactly sure if this counts as an  thought so let me know if it is or not.  i had an overnight trip to an observatory a month ago and the teacher gave a presentation about space (all the planets, ozones etc.) it was actually pretty fun to learn. however towards the end, i had found out for the first time that in 5 million (or billion? i don't really remember) the sun will explode and all life on earth would be gone.   it didn't really bother me until after i came back home that i've started worrying about it. it started when i try to go to sleep. then when i try to go about my day and whenever i look around to enjoy the moment, this damn thought pokes at me saying ""everything that you see right now will disappear""  i know that it'll happen long after i'm dead but for some reason, i keep thinking that i may come back alive in another body and experience it for real. ridiculous i know but its a thought that keeps bugging me when i try to go about my day.  surprisingly, i'm actually suprised that i'm more scared of dying by the sun exploding than being scared of death itself.   i know it sounds weird but if i do die and if we do get reincarnated into another body,  i would like to at least come back to life after the sun exploded (yeah i know its highly unlikely but hey there might be other planets with life out there. :p) or at reincarnated in a time way more earlier than now. crazy thought i know.  for some reason i feel a little better after writing this out.",0,0

"fixation on the apocalypse: how do you cope? i was once involved with a very cult-like online community of self proclaimed 'doomers' who believe that climate change and or nuclear fallout will cause the destruction of all life, probably by september 2026.  they further believed that this was inevitable, unless their geoengineering project was utilized, and that only through accepting despair and love could we achieve spiritual death/rebirth.  though i left them after i realized how toxic and hostile they were, i still see them semi-regularly on youtube and it always upsets me. i also cannot get their beliefs out of my mind, especially when i feel the compulsion to constantly check up on them and their sphere of influence.  i am constantly in fight or flight mode, constantly expecting the apocalypse and human extinction. i additionally have ocd, adhd and autism, so these have become obsessions and ruminating thoughts for me.  i know that it doesn't help anything. i know that, even if they were correct, worrying will only ruin my life. but i can't seem to stop.  i can't even enjoy reading or writing much anymore, since i can't picture a world where everything isn't mundanely catastrophic- for want of a better word.  i know that separating myself from discussions around climate change and the environment would probably help, but i'm not willing to do that- not completely at least. it is something that i am passionate about and i feel like i need to do all i can to help create solutions and systemic change- even if i can only play a small part.  is anyone else going through something similar?  do you have any advice?",0,0

" thoughts about work context: my workplace is pretty stressful, with lots of people trying to climb the corporate ladder. coworkers don't really get along as our organisation underwent a merger some time back, so the work culture is really messy. there's a lot of us vs them and the boss has her own clique, which she takes care of. (e.g: covering and granting off days more permissively while riding anyone else) people are on edge a lot, they yell at each other. people are always busy. i stay on as my contract is not up yet and the money is stable.  i recently had my performance review. one big area for improvement that was highlighted to me was that i need to manage my stress and mask my emotions better. specific instances raised: i looked stressed when asking where another manager sat. people ask if i'm ok because i'm stressed. i look like i'm rushing around.  this is an office where fully grown adults shout at each other or are causally rude to each other.  i don't disagree that i am stressed but i don't think i'm handling it any worse than people who are sleeping at their desks or raising their voices.   i'm on vacation now and i get  thoughts 7-10 times a day about work. it's really bugging me. any input or advice would be appreciated, thanks.",0,0

"1 year later (long) today marks one year since i‚Äôve speculated having ocd. in the beginning, my obsession revolves around  illnesses, particularly covid. now, it‚Äôs been sexual  thoughts involving strangers, people i know, and even family. i still have the health obsession but not to such a high degree. recently, i have an obsession with contamination. the fact that my therapist and i weren‚Äôt able to communicate properly.   i don‚Äôt think i can distinguish a compulsive need to be certain vs genuine pleasure anymore. the focus of my sexual  thoughts have always disgusted me but a year later i don‚Äôt if i‚Äôve accepted them or if i‚Äôve been lying about having ocd and i‚Äôve liked them. my sexual  thoughts ran rampant, but know i can‚Äôt tell which thoughts are  and which are truly mine. only during sex is when i‚Äôm sure that i‚Äôm experience rampant  thoughts. i just wish i had the answer or better yet i wish i was back to who i was before this started. i keep telling myself i‚Äôm one thing but with all the thoughts and compulsions i‚Äôve done; i can‚Äôt say it without it feeling like a lie. as of now, it feels like i‚Äôm liking the thoughts when i never would‚Äôve considered it a year ago.  my contamination aspect started around the covid obsession. i remember washing my hands until my skin cracked. i was never fully convinced that i was safe from covid. then, when i thought that i was exposed to a carcinogen and spreading it to others,  i washed my hands before touching items, scrubbed down items to get the carcinogen off, bought new clothes in case the carcinogen was still there, and cried whenever someone touched an item that i touched. at this point, the only only thing keeping me sane is that i have no evidence of spreading carcinogens. if i really did come into a contact with a carcinogen, then it leads to a morality crisis.   finally, my heath obsession sprung from the covid 19 pandemic. i was afraid of catching or spreading covid, so i didn‚Äôt go out outside of necessity. i would always be terrified of the ideas of covid, so i would frequently leave class to get tested, and would stay away from people. i constantly had a thermometer and oximter on stand by that i use as reassurance.",0,0

" suicidal thoughts from being sick? hi, m22 here. so for about a month i have been dealing with major sinus issues where basically fluid is trapped in my ear and not draining. i have a referral for an ent from my doctor and am waiting on an appointment to be scheduled.   ever since i got sick, my mental health has completely changed out of nowhere. i started having panic attacks, i‚Äôve had about 3 or 4 in this last month. i also have had a lot of days of feeling weird and what i say could be dissociation and lightheaded.   i also started now having a nonstop thought about what if i wanted to commit suicide or what if i go crazy enough in my mind to. i‚Äôve never been depressed or suicidal, and i‚Äôm not sure if this is all just linked to being sick. i‚Äôve always had some anxiety, but rarely ever have had panic attacks either.   i am very bad about self diagnosing and looking at the depression and suicidal subreddits nonstop, and it makes me feel like i‚Äôm now in that bracket even though i have way too much to lose. i‚Äôm young, make good money, have a wife and great family, and want to live until i‚Äôm old. so why am i having this random thought about suicide that doesn‚Äôt seem to go away? do i just try and accept it for what it is? is it just a  thought? i‚Äôm struggling to know if i‚Äôm actually becoming a suicidal person or not. i‚Äôm not sure how to get rid of these thoughts, and am just in a weird situation right now.   i‚Äôd like to figure out how to get back to how i was a month ago, where i was absolutely loving my life. it‚Äôs like there was this sudden switch and now i‚Äôm just always panicking and thinking i‚Äôm now depressed or something out of the blue.   the only thing that‚Äôs changed with me is these sinus issues that won‚Äôt go away with medicine. could this all be attributed to this? do i just try to get better from being sick and maybe i‚Äôll be back to normal?",0,0

"resources and information there should be a section on the subreddit to redirect people to information and respected pertaining to  thoughts! i see a lot of misinformation (sometimes hateful in nature) and bad advice on here that will only serve to make those experiencing distress from  thoughts worsen.   if you are experiencing distress from unwanted  thoughts (often disturbing in content) you are not alone! 94% of people admit to experiencing such thoughts, but not all ‚Äútune in‚Äù and pay them attention.    thoughts are a product of over policing thoughts, and thus, are the opposite of impulses, though when the amygdala fires off, the brain experience ‚Äúthought-action blur‚Äù which temporarily weakens the mind‚Äôs ability to differentiate between thoughts and actions. you can identify  thoughts because they seem ‚Äúalien‚Äù- you do not want to be having them and they make you uncomfortable or distressed.   once you recognize what an  thought is, remember: thoughts cannot be harmful or dangerous, though the anxiety often makes it seem that way. they are just thoughts. they do not equal reality. you are not your thoughts. if you fight them, they will fight back, and often become recurring (or ‚Äústick‚Äù). ‚Äúwhat you resist persists‚Äù. your brain will return to try and solve a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist and can‚Äôt be solved. ‚Äúneurons that fire together wire together‚Äù. reassuring yourself with false comfort (i.e. listing all the reasons you‚Äôre not a bad person) will never satisfy the worried mind and serves to reinforce the  thought. knowing they are a product of over controlling the thoughts (telling them they can‚Äôt happen), instead accept that they are happening and allow them to happen. just ‚Äúfloat and feel‚Äù. don‚Äôt suppress or repress, just watch yourself experience the thoughts and feelings. let time pass.   thoughts will happen again, it is the nature of the mind, but you can equip yourself with attitudes and skills to rewire how your brain reacts to them. they are false fear constructs that your amygdala reacts to. you can‚Äôt control that they happen, or even the initial ‚Äúunthinking‚Äù reaction to them, but you can learn to respond afterward.   if you are experiencing severe emotional distress or social thoughts, please let someone try and help you. i apologize that the information cannot be more exhaustive- please take an inverted interest in helping yourself and finding good help.   information on  thoughts:  https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/unwanted--thoughts  https://www.northpointrecovery.com/blog/7-tips-deal-stop--thoughts/  this book contains tons of up to date information and a whole chapter on dispelling myths about  thoughts:   https://www.amazon.com/dp/1626254346/ref=cm_sw_r_awdo_9n2sn1xe9cebxdghr9rg  for those experiencing suicidal feelings:   988 has been designated as the new three-digit dialing code that will route callers to the national suicide prevention lifeline. while some areas may be currently able to connect to the lifeline by dialing 988, this dialing code will be available to everyone across the united states starting on july 16, 2022.  the current lifeline phone number (1-800-273-8255) will always remain available to people in emotional distress or suicidal crisis, even after 988 is launched nationally.",0,0

"pocd recovery with ali greymond? i'm interested in starting therapy with ali graymond...  just a little backstory: i have what i consider to be severe pocd (never been officialy diagnosed, but my former therapist said i did) that comes with many symptoms. rumination, reassurance, (what i hope is) false attraction, ect. i used to have alot of anxiety in the first month or two of dealing with it, but now it is all gone it feels like. i remember not being able to eat or sleep and do anything but seek reassurance and ruminate all day. i honestly don't know what changed, it's like one day i woke up and the anxiety was gone. i remember when it first happened i used to work myself up to the point where i would kind of 'force's myself to get anxious and cry and stuff. now very few (if any) things my pocd throws at me seems to cause me anxiety. i'm worried erp therapy won't help me and i'll be stuck like this forever. i want erp therapy to work, i want anxiety but at the same time it feels like i'm lying, even as i write this. i remember before this i never really thought of kids, never liked or hated them. they were just there. now i feel lost and ""off"" most of the time and i don't know how to fix it. i want my normal attraction and interests back. i'm suffering everyday, just going through the motions.  also some people say that ocd is an anxiety disorder while some don't,  i'm honestly so confused and don't know what to think.   so my question is: has anyone had pocd and recovered with ali greymond? and can she help me even though my anxiety is gone? can i get better? is this normal?",0,0

"what do i do now? hello, i used to get very angry. i learned how to control it as i grew up, but it used to be a big problem i got sent to juvenile twice because of it. every time i bring it up to someone they think it's not a big deal because i don't want to tell them the whole story. they will think i'm crazy. i can't ever tell someone i get so angry i bash my steering wheel and scream at the top of my lungs ""kill kill kill"" the one time i did the guy didn't take me seriously. i don't want to hurt anyone but it's like everything builds up and i can't tell anyone about it no one wants to hear it and i dont blame them. i started losing friends because nobody cares and it gets tiring for them. so i stopped telling people things i stopped losing friends but for some reason i couldn't be around them without feeling sad and suicidal. after months of working 60hrs a week and never hanging out anymore i started to lose more friends because i didnt spend time with them. that's when i started cutting my arms and legs. it was in places nobody would see. i had excuses if they did see them somehow. after learning about my past 2 attempts they wanted me to tell them things more but i can't do it. i tell them the bare minimum but its pointless selfish and stupid i just wish i didn't have problems. i end up unleashing all my anger onto a heavy bag. the only thing that made me calm when i got home was having my buddy here with me. he was a good boy and he passed away because of me. i got drunk and overdosed on 70g of ibuprofen a few weeks ago and woke up in my sleep throwing it up and passed out on my bed. i think he got some of it and he passed from either kidney or liver failure. i took him to the vet and on the way there i played my favorite playlist in the car and prayed to god to help my buddy. the vet said there's basically nothing he could do and gave him a shot of depo medrol. which is a steroidal anti inflamitory. i don't know if that couldve made it worse but he didnt seem like he was going to pass away. it was very sudden. when he passed i felt so angry and guilty. i prayed to god to save my dog and punish me not him. when he passed i think i lost faith in that bastard piece of shit god. what the fuck good has he ever done for me. my many years of faith and all he has done is take away my dog, my grandpa, and made me feel the things i do. i couldn't even listen to my favorite music without being reminded of my dog passing away because of me. i felt so guilty the same night he passed i drank a bottle of lighter fluid and went speeding hoping to get pulled over to use my knife and get shot. nobody pulled me over even though i passed by 2 cops going 60 in a 30. at one point i was going 120mph in a 50. i was going to order needles and potassium chloride. i haven't done it. but i need to know if this will ever go away, i just want to be left alone but not physically if that makes sense. i almost killed myself out of guilt and desperation a month ago when i stole a gun from my grandmas and rented a hotel room at a beach. i tried to shoot myself at the beach and in the hotel but i couldn't do it. it made my problems seem miniscule when i was about to pull the trigger the last time. i pulled it 3 times and didn't do it on the last one. the thought of going home and chilling with my buddy was enough to make me put the gun down. i attempted suicide 4 times in my life and half way attempted 2 times. people only know about the last two. since with the gun i chickened out, i will not get that opportunity again for a long time. i had to tell them because it was their gun. and my buddy passed away. i couldn't keep that a secret out of respect for him. i know i'm not just angry, i'm sad, exhausted, and just ready for this shit be through. what is all of this even for in the first place. for a while i held a knife to my stomach every night in hopes i would get the courage to just do it but i never could because i am a wimp.  i'm 19, i am entering a cna program and next month is my first class. recently i noticed i can ignore the negative thoughts but it feels like something is missing. and when i'm by myself especially at night in my room i think about it again and it feels bad but the thing that felt wrong like it was missing doesnt feel missing anymore. it makes me want to curl into a ball and i sometimes grip my arm very hard because it's just a difficult thought to have but i feel like i should not be alive. and when someone is there for me and tells me things i like to hear i know i don't deserve them i've done nothing with my life so far except be a burden literally. it's painful to ignore it and painful to acknowledge it. i don't know what to do. i hate the mental hospital, i have been there twice before and it only made me worse. the experience was negative both times. if i ever have to go back there again i'm doing as much damage as possible the people taking me so please do not report this for any reason.",0,0

"my  thoughts make me feel like an awful person i'm gonna cut to the chase, i have a ton of unresolved mental issues. i've had severe separation anxiety since i was very little and it's only gotten worse as i've been with my boyfriend, and so i am now very codependent as is he. i have terrible general, social, and health anxiety and bouts of depression with suicidal thought. terrible, violent anger issues and mood swings. possible and likely borderline personality disorder and i have a hunch that my ""giftedness"" i've been told about since i was very young is actually undiagnosed autism. i am all around very rarely pleasant to be around.  i think all of this extrapolates, or may be extrapolated by, my  thoughts. i absolutely adore animals with the entire fiber of my being, i want to be a veterinarian and have been wanting that since i was very young, but i often have  thoughts about hurting my dogs, my cat. when i used to own rats, i would cry cause i couldn't stop the thoughts about swinging them by their tails against the wall. obviously, these are incredibly distressing thoughts and i'd never act on them, but they make me feel terrible. i love my mom, she's the strongest, most hard-working person i've ever met in my entire life.  thoughts scream at me to stab her and watch her bleed out. my boyfriend, an absolute saint. the most kind, intelligent, empathetic person on the planet.  thoughts tell me to kill him, cook him, eat him.  the least distressing are the thoughts about myself, slitting my wrists or ripping my teeth out or slicing off my fingers. still distressing, but i care less about what happens to me than to my animals, my mom, my boyfriend, etc. i'd never act on these things, of course, not in a million years. but the fact that the thoughts even cross my mind at all fucking destroys me from the inside out. i should be imprisoned for even thinking these incredibly disturbing, disgusting things, even if i really know i have no control over this. i know it's not me. but i still feel like a garbage, terrible, shit person. i'm not saying that i'm a danger to these people and animals, not in the slightest, or that i'm a danger to myself. i'm just seriously disturbed by my own mind.",0,0

" thoughts about a girl i was hooking up with i have been hung up on a friend of a friend i was hooking up with last summer no longer wishing to see or talk to me for almost a year now.  i have gotten so much better since then, to the point that i‚Äôm no longer laying in bed all day and night in states of depression, but the pain and  thoughts still lingers where i feel it control my livelihood and wellbeing to a decent degree.  i have wondered how likely it is that i have ocd, this would be the wake up call for me if i did get diagnosed with it. i just started seeing a psychiatrist for the first time ever a month ago and they prescribed me wellbutrin to enhance my celexa prescription i‚Äôve been taking, but i don‚Äôt feel they‚Äôre adequately aware of how incredibly destroyed my life has been since last summer.   i have a therapist, and he has been unable to accurately pinpoint whether or not i have ocd or if it‚Äôs gad, which he leans closer towards. i think next time i see the psychiatrist i‚Äôm going to practically beg them to refer me to an ocd specialist who can give me a test to see what the results are.   the  thoughts have basically made this girl the be all-end all of every facet of my life. she got angry and frightened of me continuously contacting her and told me off and to leave her alone. i‚Äôm glad she didn‚Äôt file a restraining order against me. i don‚Äôt hold anything against her because she had gotten out of an abusive relationship prior to seeing me with an ex who stalked her and would possibly harm her if he found out where her new living situation was.   anyways, the  thoughts are always involving her, but they have varying levels of radical-ness/extreme-ness. there‚Äôs the basic thoughts like what is she doing now? who is she dating? is she getting married? how is she doing emotionally/financially? is she happier than i am now? is she doing better than i am?  then the  thoughts take on more of an edge: is she getting wasted and hooking up with strangers at bars? is she having trashy hotel sex with guys taking advantage of her? is she going to get knocked up with some random guy‚Äôs baby? is she hanging around with guys who banter on the local neighborhood street corner and going back to their place to sleep with them? is she having an affair with anyone? is she having spontaneous hook ups like you would see in porn? hell, is she doing porn?   then there‚Äôs  thoughts where she still has a say or involvement in my life, nearly a year after we stopped talking, like what would she say about me talking to or dating this other person? what would she think of my new job or any other endeavors i‚Äôm doing? oh no, i have a health complication, i need to tell her about it and get her opinion.   i felt like this was the only sub i could post these things to because any other sub like dating or relationship advice would be negative about these thoughts i have. obviously i can‚Äôt go to this girl about these thoughts because she is extremely uncomfortable with me and she would only react angrily and probably get creeped out that i‚Äôm still thinking about her almost a year after us seeing each other. even my friend that introduced us to each other has become noticeably concerned about how much i have been affected by this. some nights i wake up in a state of panic wondering how on earth i have gotten to such a state of obsession with another person and allowed myself to be consumed by such a minor fling. it scares me just as much as i‚Äôve scared this person.  please give me any support or guidance that you can. i feel like a crazy person over this girl. i‚Äôve had the most suicidal thoughts i‚Äôve ever had in my life this past year. i wish i had one of those memory erasers from men in black that could wipe all involvement ive had with this girl.    thanks for reading.",0,0

"my(24m) anxiety and  thoughts are ruining my relationship with my fiance(32f) there's so so much to our relationship that i cant type it all so i'll do my best to keep this short and simple. we have been together for over 4 years. we used to live together but she took an overdose in january so we decided it would be best for her to move back home with her mother whilst she recovered and went through therapy etc. she lives about 2 hours drive away, so i go to see her at weekends like i used to before we moved in together. i have suffered with terrible anxiety for years along with retroactive jealousy disorder and  thoughts. i had got good at blocking out these things, but with her living away, i have slowly slipped back into it. i have recently started therapy for this, which has re opened a lot of my wounds so to speak. anyone that has experienced this will know what i mean.  the majority of my  thoughts and anxieties are sexual, graphic mental movies or sexual thoughts of not being good enough or satisfying her, so she has to find someone else etc. she's never really been overly sexual and hasn't masturbated much before. i know i can make her finish through oral or using my hands/fingers etc, but when we have penetrative sex i finish quite fast, not prematurely but a few minutes i'd say, which can't be enjoyable for her even if she says it is. i should also say that due to the age difference she has had previous partners, whereas she was my first proper sexual partner. my biggest insecurities are all around sex. i have anxieties like, am i good enough? does she enjoy it? when she closes her eyes, is she thinking of other people? do i compare to her exes? so on and so forth.  i was kinda dealing with that and getting on with it but recently she has got more sexual, which was good for me, even though i thought it had come out of nowhere. but then the other day i found some toys that she uses on her own and doesn't want us to use them together. which obviously triggered my anxiety and insecurities massively, so i caved in and had to ask her. it was a calm conversation as we never raise our voice or argue aggressively. she told me that i do satisfy her but when it's on her own she is able to clear her mind, enjoy it and not worry about making me finish too. i asked if she thinks of other people or anything like that and she says no, but then my head tells me she would say that even if it wasn't the case. so i can't win. she says she just reads erotica, but then that also hits my insecurities as i don't masturbate or watch porn at all these days, as she is all i want. would that not mean i am not enough if she has to use other things to stimulate her? i trust her completely and know she wouldn't be unfaithful but it plays on my mind. asking for constant reassurance just makes things worse.  as we don't live together we can't have a face to face conversation so it's all over text as we are both busy until we can call. she got annoyed and said she wanted some time to herself before she said something she regretted, which in my head would be her saying something that confirms my insecurities.what else could she regret saying? she also said she isn't happy analyzing her sex toys and having her personal moments twisted in a way that makes me feel bad as its not fair and not ok. which i completely agree with but i cannot help it. i don't know how to believe her when she says things, even if it's what i want to hear, my head just tells me she is just saying it.  so i would like some advice on what i should do. i am getting help for my  thoughts and anxiety, but i feel that my insecurities are genuine and not a product i've made up in my mind. how do i accept it and stop bothering about it? how do i accept what she says as truth and just let her masturbate however she likes? i have so much bouncing around in my head and would appreciate others thoughts on the matter please",0,0

" thoughts latching onto people? i've been struggling with  thought more now than in my whole life. usually sexual  thoughts, moral based, and relationship based. but i noticed my mind will try to create an entire story thst isn't real it almost feels like and it'll latch onto random things and people. and one has really been getting to me lately, i was looking through old pictures and i found some old pictures of someone i use to be friends with. some backstop, he liked me at the time, and i was in the process of trying to move on so as much as in reality i only seen him as a close friend felt like i should try to move on so i tried to kind of force myself to like him as more kind of? anyways, long story short i told him how i really felt about being friends and i offered to just stay friends and it didn't work out, he became a little obsessive so i blocked him and forgot about it til yesterday. i let it go after seeing the pictures basically. but then i had a dream where i was in a airport and i was picking my bf up and talking to my parents and when i walked off i ran into him and he said ""how heart warming"" and that was the only encounter. after that dream i woke up and my mind latched onto the dream saying that it meant something and that it means i was cheating, a bad person, etc and then since yesterday everytime i started to forget and started thinking about my bf, my mind would be like ""you haven't figured out the dream yet"" and then my bfs face would be replaced with his and then itd be so distressing that i kind of just have to hold my head and wait for it to go away and then deal with guilt after. i know i don't want these thoughts, but it almost feels like its nit even really about the guy, but instead he's associated with anxiety now so he's the face of my anxiety kind of thing and this happens everytime it feels like my mind latches onto someone.. anyone else relate or have anything that helps this because even though i know i don't want this i still feel guilt for it and if it stays long enough i start believing that its wanted and not  which is even more scary",0,0

"are these  thoughts? hi, hoping to find some answers here. i often find myself dwelling on things and i cannot stop obsessing. usually stems from saying something i regret, because it came off differently then i intended. or in situations where i feel i am unliked. i play these situations over and over in my head. it often leads into i should of said/done this and my brain will go off on these tangents  over and over. i cannot make them stop. i make myself feel ill. i make myself cry. i make these people in my head say and do such mean things, i hurt my own feelings. it causes a lot of anxiety. i don't want to ever see these people or go to any type of events because of all the what ifs. even just typing this i want to throw up. i feel like all over the internet it seems like  thoughts, but i don't want to harm others or myself and that specificly seems to be the 'theme' with  thoughts, or at least that's what makes it? i'm not really sure. i honestly only thought it could be  thoughts about 6 hours ago.  i am diagnosed generalized anxiety, adhd, and ""mood disorder"" i take lamictal (bipolar meds, however i don't think meet all the checks for that diagnoses) and methylphenidate  for the adhd daily. not sure if that matters?   since being on these med i feel much more grounded and present. i was so easily able to zone out and be on auto pilot before, but now i feel as tho i actually have to face and deal with these things. it's been like this since i can remember tbh. there's a lot of trauma i've ignored for years that i am finally trying to over come, but that's a whole can of worms for another time.  anyways, thank you in advance! i hope to at least figure out what path i should head down to over come this.",0,0

"pocd is ruining my life i can‚Äôt exactly pin point to the exact moment this occurred and this is very difficult for me to type but for months now i have been suffering from pocd. one thing i will say is that i know for a fact i would never sexually harm a kid nor anyone  and i‚Äôm not sexually attracted to children but the fact that these disturbing images keep playing in my mind makes me sick to my stomach. earlier last year i was staying at a relatives who‚Äôs children are like my children. i take them to school get them dressed change them etc and i love the hell out of them and the only thing i want to ever see them do is win and make it in this world. one day (under the influence) i had a random thought come to mind of someone harming one of the children and i instantly thought that‚Äôs fucked up why would i think of that. but i kept it pushing ,maybe 2-3 weeks later i had a nightmare someone who bullied me as a kid sexually abused my cousin who is like my own kid and i woke up heart racing chest tight and lightheaded. even though it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs business but the child i love as if he was my own is non verbal autistic and my biggest fear is someone harming him ,whether it‚Äôs physical sexual or whatever just downright taking advantage of him not being able to talk. i went to work and told a coworker about the scary dream and thought it was done. but now let‚Äôs talk about hell. i would sleep in the basement and the kids sometimes would randomly come down to play video games or just bother me but im grown and sometimes i want that alone time to masturbate or be on the phone. but i used to be scared because i never knew when they would come down there and i don‚Äôt want them walking in on me. so with that fear always on my mind i guess i would have random moments where they‚Äôd be on my mind while i‚Äôm pleasuring myself. i wouldn‚Äôt think of them in a sexual sense but the fear of getting caught. it started being that after a while of having that constant fear i began seeing these unwanted images of people harming them and i was grossed out and it made me sad. now i thought it was over but then i had these images of me doing it and i immediately felt sick i remember thinking ‚Äúi know i would never‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm not a pedophile‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm going to hell‚Äù etc. these images happend every blue moon. one day i was laying nude in my bed sound asleep when i woke up my cousin (who i mentioned is like my own kid) was asleep next to me. i immediately rushed and put clothes on. i thought he was upstairs in bed but i forget sometimes he gets up in the middle of the night to find someone to lay with. i was so scared and began overthinking ‚Äúhis mom is going to think i did something to him‚Äù i was truly in a ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what it looks like‚Äùmoment. after some time once again these damn unwanted  thoughts began to rome and they started fucking up my life. when i would take the kids to school and see the other children all i could see was someone harming them , i had so much anxiety to the point i felt as if i couldn‚Äôt breathe so i started isolating myself from the kids and a lot of my family,tried weed and alcohol to calm me down which at first was working but slowly began to make things worse. i truly believed that i was in hell. i know i‚Äôm not into kids i know i wouldn‚Äôt harm them so why would these thoughts keep happening. i didn‚Äôt want to be around anyone i felt like i had been losing my mind. i felt so alone i felt sick i felt like a monster just a sick person. like don‚Äôt you have thoughts only about things you want ? what makes it worse is i literally would just disappear from most spaces because i know kids would be present. i know i wouldn‚Äôt harm anyone but the more people were around the more thoughts i would have. i would ask if this was a punishment i‚Äôd pray everyday that these thoughts would stop everytime i see a sex scene or anything sexual related a kid would pop up in my mind,family members just so many despicable thoughts. i dread being around kids and what makes matters worse is i can‚Äôt exactly explain my situation to ppl out of fear they would think i‚Äôm a pedophile or that i would try to harm their kids. i‚Äôve managed to tell some people and they completely understand (at least that‚Äôs what they tell me idk if they might be lying) i‚Äôm going to therapy but my therapist just asks generic questions and i fear i won‚Äôt ever be able to see my babies again and also think people can see my problems. this is killing me i just want it all to stop i wake up every morning noon and night not breathing shaking and overthinking. i just want to die sometimes cuz i feel like a evil sick person. i don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone i just want it to stop",0,0

"racist  thoughts i am a cisgender white male in my 20s and i'm on the tip of the autism spectrum, for the past few weeks the n-word has become an  thought in my mind and i hate myself so much for it. it pops up without rhyme or reason simply as just the word, and other times it's as a memory of any video where it's used such as a clip from the show the boondocks or a video i've seen on vine when that app was still around. it starts popping in the most around the last couple hours of work every day and the more i try to think about something like a personal project or try to focus on a podcast, the more the word forces itself in, which makes me feel extremely anxious and disgusted with myself for thinking it.   by the time i get home i feel so horrified, tense, and angry at myself for thinking the word so much that i act on the compulsion to punch myself in the head until my energy is spent, my ears are ringing, and i have a headache. my jaw is starting to feel sore when i open my mouth wide enough to eat food because of how frequently and hard i've been punching myself in that area. i've even been starting to try and choke myself until i gag and dry heave. at work i've been starting to develop this compulsion to flick myself in the forehead when no one is around anytime that word starts popping into my head.  &#x200b;  i'm scared that these thoughts mean i'm actually a bad person, and i'm tariffed by the thought that this word might one day slip from my lips and if anyone heard it, they would never believe me if i tried to explain what's happening inside my head. i hate myself for having these thoughts, and i wish i knew how to just make it stop.",0,0

"intsuvie thoughts update 2 1 year later hey everyone. i just wanted to take the time to type down my thoughts for both must and other people to read them.  almost a year ago in april, i last posted here. if you are interested in reading it, it's the first post on my profile. but i will give you a quick rundown of what i had to say.  basically, my thoughts came in the form of pure ocd.  what the thoughts was phrases that would repeat in my head over and over again, like a catchy song on loop. and these phrases were truly horrible. most had to do with sexual things, phrases repeating in my head like ""imagine you and your mom having hot sex,"" or something like that (i'm not saying that phrase specifically, but things along that name) these thoughts would be about anyone and everyone. random people on the street, babies, family members. hell, i couldn't even read people's names on the internet without thinking those kinds of thoughs about them. my biggest fear was ""they don't know this random person is thinking said thoughts about them right now.""  it was like that everyday for a while and as a 16 year old, i freaked the fuck out (as you could imagine).  it's now almost a year later. i am not sure if my intsuvie thoughts got better or not.  for one, the phrases in my head no longer bother me as much. they don't repeat in my head all the time like they once did. even when they do, i don't think too deeply into them and only think of them as random, meaningless words. of course, there are times where i relapse for a bit, and try to replace the bad phrase with a good one and it starts the cycle over again for a bit. but overall, they don't bother me nearly as much as they did.  as far as going out in public goes, it has gotten much much better, actually. i went to go out and visit a family member for the weekend twice last month. i was going to go today, but just didn't feel the energy to do so. last week (or it was most likely the week before the last) went out in public twice that week for a job placement program. hardly thought aboht any intsuvie thoughts, only a little bit which was amazing.  only thing is i still can't look at babies.  now i would say i have improved, but i'm not so sure.  now i've sort of devoloped fears in consequence to my previous thoughts. now, i have sort of have a fear of thinking those thoughts at all. so i kinda get scared of thinks that may trigger those thoughts and feelings happening again.   for example, when i hear my family members moving around or talking, specifically in the morning for some reason. i get scared that even that may trigger the thought to happen again.   i also have a sort of fear around being around my older brother. this may be because he has a history and issues that i'd rather not get into that makes me feel extremely guilty thinking intsuvie thoughts about him specifically. so i try my best to avoid him a lot in general, which sucks. i avoid also looking people in the face and my counselers face on video chat because i fear thinking of those thoughts i hope that gets better. i bought some earplugs in an effort to help ease the situation.  more recently as in like this year, because the words repeating in my head stopped bothering me as much, my brain has resorted to pushing images in my head that i don't want to think. like i guess as some last resort in an effort to get me to obsess over something again. (lol)  and it worked. my mom recently started staying in the living room, and to get into the kitchen i would have to go through her. so everytime i try to walk past her, an image would flash inside of my head that i didn't want to think and i hated it. or when i'm in the kitchen with her or something, the images would try to flash in my head to anger me. or when anytime something upsetting was happening, the images would flash into my head and i would get more upset, things like that.  however, i am using past tense for that because it has gotten better.  like, it's like my brain trained itself to make those images in my head stop appearing so easily. now those images take much more effort to think up. sure, it makes it harder to imagine things, but it feels so much better. sure, i still relapse now and again, but its still much easier to handle than before. the human brain is amazing, isn't it?  the most recent thing i am struggling with is having an incredibly negative mindset, to the point where i can't enjoy things.  for example, let's say i'm jacking off or something, i can't stop guilt tripping myself over mundane things like ""you didn't call your grandmother this week, you're jacking off instead of calling your grandmother"". or when i'm drawing or something ""why are you drawing instead of doing your homework?"" ""why are you drawing when you didn't walk outside today"" ""why are you drawing when you didn't brush your teeth?"" or when i make a simple mistake, i can't stop obsessing over it and guilt tripping myself.  basically, i devoloped a really bad habit of guilt tripping myself whenever i do something i enjoy.   another thing is whenever i like something, i can't help but ruin it for myself.  say for example, i'm watching a movie right. i like it and i love it. well then after a while, i can't stop thinking about the movie's flaws to the point where i cant enjoy it anymore. or i obsess over the opinions of others that i disagree with. even if a large amount of people agree with me, i can stop thinking about the opinions i dislike.  those are the most recent ones i'm dealing with currently. i just cannot stop thinking and obsessing about the negative things, even if there are an overwhelming amount of positive things to consider. it's like if 99 people share the same opinion as me, i can't stop thinking or obsessing over that 1 person that disagrees. i don't want to think about it, but i can't help but think about it. if anyone has any suggestions about how to stop thinking negative and to focus on the positive and stop guilt tripping myself i would love to hear it.  anyways, that's about it. i think i will make another post sometime later about my most recent issue. i'll update if there are any changes or progress. thanks for reading. :)",0,0

" violent a though disappeared so i‚Äôve had this thing for maybe over a year, when i‚Äôm on the train i imagine someone falling in to the tracks or in public i imagine hurting them, like punching them or pushing them or walking past an annoying kid and wanting to kick them out the way. i‚Äôd call them  thoughts that make me laugh to myself at times. i can remember a month ago i was having these random thoughts coming in to my brain too. but yesterday something was different, when looking at anyone i couldn‚Äôt even make my mind do it. it was sort of habitual but i didn‚Äôt feel the need at all. i was wondering why? why have i stopped doing this? in my brain i thought nah i don‚Äôt feel like it. i must mention i have a history of depression, anxiety and went through something a little traumatising a couple of months ago, but i took some time for myself, my mind was almost calmer. why have the violent thoughts stopped?",0,0

"needed to get this out of me i‚Äôm a (25 m) who started a family at 19. i thought the american dream of having a family, house, and a decent job would make me happy. it‚Äôs what i never had growing up. i joined the military and achieved that ‚Äúdream‚Äù.. and once i got to that point in my life i still wasn‚Äôt happy. in fact my mental health declined sharply upon joining the military. i lived in denial. i disregarded my own internal problems and shoved them down deep inside just as the military conditions you to do with your thoughts and emotions.   slowly over time it took a toll on my marriage. i was bitter, emotionless, slept all day, didn‚Äôt take care of myself. it‚Äôs not like i didn‚Äôt love my wife and kids even if my relationship wasn‚Äôt that healthy. i was just so lost in my own head and hated myself to the core. i never felt good enough. like i‚Äôm not enough and idk that i ever will be.   last year i deployed and that‚Äôs when i hit my rock bottom. i asked for a divorce, slept with another woman (thinking my marriage was the issue), and i drank heavily for a solid 3 months. everyday. every night. i enjoyed the numbness. i returned home from that deployment and continued the drinking. got put on antidepressants which only intensified the drunk. began snorting other pills just to take it up a notch because the drinking wasn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. i began to see other women and begin the process of selling our house to move on from my marriage. i then began to regret my decision after sleeping with a few women. the grass wasn‚Äôt necessarily greener on the other side. i wanted to try again to fix my marriage and get some help but my wife met this guy at a bar that she became excited about. at first i acted like i supported it because i was a piece of shit and felt she deserved better than me. deep down i didn‚Äôt want that at all. i began to watch my wife of 6 years fall for another man in the matter of weeks.   that‚Äôs when my suicidal thoughts began to consume my mind. i felt i was the problem and i was the one in the way of everyone‚Äôs happiness. i felt her and my kids would be better off without me. plus if i killed myself they‚Äôd get 400k of life insurance for them to start a fresh life with. my plan was to blow my brains out in my  with the door locked so my kids wouldn‚Äôt be the ones to find me. i wrote out letters to each of them apologizing and gave them my hopes and dreams for them along with some last minute fatherly life advice.   the night i had planned to do it i was supposed to have the house to myself but my wife asked for me to watch the kids while she went out on a date with that guy. which ended up saving my life. i got as far as putting the barrel in my mouth and i couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it because my kids would have woke up from the gunshot.   the very next day i had a psychiatric appointment and i broke down. told them everything. they immediately put me into a psychiatric hospital. the hospital had a program for military members and first responders that focused in on trauma and substance abuse. i was there for 2 months and got the help i desperately needed.   feeling like a new man i asked my wife to give me another chance.. she didn‚Äôt. she moved out of our house and took the kids with her to go live with this man while i was in that program. i came home to an empty house.  while i do feel much better, i still struggle with my suicidal thoughts everyday. i just want the struggle to stop. i want to feel like i‚Äôm not trapped in a life i don‚Äôt want to live anymore.",0,0

"racism is making my life miserable in fall of last year, one of my old friends passed away. i hadn‚Äôt seen him since sixth grade (i‚Äôm graduating hs now) and i don‚Äôt know why but i struggled processing his death. in fact, i still do. maybe it‚Äôs because i moved across the country or because i haven‚Äôt seen him in six years but i haven‚Äôt once cried/mourned his death. i stare at pictures of him, play old memories of him in my head, but no matter how much i try to force myself to feel the way i‚Äôm supposed to feel about a late friend, i never cry.   one night, while under the influence of cannabis, i had a terrible thought in my head: ‚Äúi don‚Äôt care about his death because he was black.‚Äù i felt terrible. i don‚Äôt know if it was the weed but my mind had convinced myself that this was the reason i didn‚Äôt mourn and that i was a racist. when i disregarded this thought it came back 10 fold, festering in my head and filling me with guilt.  the main trigger for this guilt was either seeing or listening to poc. sometimes i think i‚Äôve ‚Äúcracked‚Äù the code to my thoughts and that i have grown out of them but then they come back and so does the guilt. i listen to rap music everyday by african-american artists but i can never truly enjoy it because i have a pit in my stomach that will always form whenever i‚Äôm listening to it. i‚Äôm sick and tired of this and it‚Äôs ruining my life.   that ‚Äòone night‚Äô i referred to at the beginning of this post was 4 months ago and now i am guilt-ridden everyday. i just want to know if anyone out there has been in a situation like this and how to deal with it. i believe that all people are equal and if i could shoot a klansman in the face i would but now my brain has made me it‚Äôs own worst enemy.  im sorry if this offends you, i‚Äôm aware of how ridiculous this all sounds. honestly i might just need professional help but why not ask the internet first?",0,0

"vomiting my experiences for comfort tw: death, own death, menstruation, depression   caution this is a long text.  to start of i had been sick for a while early 2020 with lots of nausea, and to this day i am sure it was part of my period symptoms. when i went to my doctor, he said it could come from a hidden depression, since he knows my family and that i had seen a therapist before about anxiety already. i thought ""okay i am a little depressed, i can fix that"".  barely a week later, when i was alone at home, nausea struck me again. i felt weak, tired, and stressed out from it. and i had the single thought ""why am i still putting up with this?""  my anxiety was awakened. i questioned this thought. why would i think that, i don't want to die! stop overrreacting! my anxiety grasped this thought and many more. i kept overrreacting. every little thing i did was an idea how to end myself. take the matches, burn the house. ride my bike, get run over by a car. it all seemed so scary, i didn't want this, where did these thoughts come from?  i sought my therapist after just a year of leaving therapy. she assured me these were  thoughts, not my own. not what i wanted. not anything i'd go and listen to. it calmed me. i got prescriped mirtazapin, something to help me sleep since i suffered insomnia from all the overthinking. since covid just started i stopped college, spent half a year at home, focusing on life in front of me. i picked up a training since i needed structure in life. things became better. i also started taking birth control to regulate my period. i started to feel overall better. anxiety lessened. i gained back control.  early 2021 i had a relapse, probably because i accidentally ran out of birth control for a month, causing my hormones to run wild. my thoughts became a mess again. i was shaken. what if that happened again and again? i hadn't been to my therapist in a while, so i reached out to her again. slowly it became better again. i was scared by my thoughts but also annoyed. trying to combat these thoughts. yes i'm supposed to not pay attention, they are just thoughts but it was difficult. work helped me distracting myself. and i met a bunch of online friends where i all my attention went towards.  during summer because of some stress and familial problems it gave me some sleep problems again. i had been off mirtazapin since the beginning of 2021 which hadn't been a problem either. now i am off birth control completely again since end of 2021. i felt that i had some down days everytime the pill cycle was about to be over and didn't wanna risk it anymore. i feared it would become worse after i stop but the first two/three months went quite well.  now the past two months changed me. i received some worrying news about my grandparents health which made me feel down. it made my thoughts worse. they changed a little from the repetitive 'i wanna die"" and similar to ""for what do we even live"" and ""how long do i have to suffer like this"" up to ""i want a break"".  i have long developed these thoughts into ""what if this never goes away?"" and ""what if i am stuck with this forever? what if i get depressed, become that depressed that i can't take it anymore"". from early on, through media and all, you always have this connection between these two topics. they scare me.  i think my menstruation cycle, my hormones, make this stronger. before my last period i had a big downfall for two weeks. my thoughts had been scaring me. i wanted a break so badly. i cried for the first time about this in two years, i always tried to hold myself back but couldn't that day. i am so scared of being weak, of giving up. and just when i cried, i had two minutes of bliss, started laughing about my own stupidity of not having cried before, only to get a burst of anxiety right after.  after my period was over, i had the best three weeks for a while. suddenly my thoughts were minor, quiet, it was wonderful. i didn't care about them. no anxiety, silent sleep, no worries. i told myself like this i could live forever.  then pms stabbed me. i noticed it at work. from one day to the other, i couldn't shake off a thought as easily. noticed a slight lack of motivation.  two days ago it happened then. sometimes there's nights where i wake up and can't fall asleep anymore because of the thoughts. but... that night i woke up 4/5am, in the span of two minutes the thoughts jumped at me, my anxiety jumped at them, wrecked me. i tried to distract myself only to force myself to go to work with shaking legs and exhaustion a couple hours later. it didn't let go of me. i couldn't focus on my work, couldn't talk much to my colleagues. couldn't pay attention, chained to the mess of my mind and my symptoms. my boss and coworkers noticed and told me to take it easy, get some tea. i must have been pale as hell. i recovered finally after a while and it all calmed down.   but as long as these feelings and thoughts were stuck with me, i wanted a break so bad. and the worst in that moment is my own mind telling me ""the only thing giving you a break is death"". it's not something i want to do. i want to live happily. without these thoughts i would be happy, carefree. but for over two years straight, they have been there. it scared me. it still does. i am scared of this ocurring every month.  my therapist said to me i have to focus on the weeks of happiness i had before. i know this is a roller coaster. but this honestly just scared me. the thought scared me. i don't want this reoccurring every month like that. because it's true i want a break from this. i am so scared to hurt myself or agree with my thoughts one day.   thoughts can vary. i have skimmed through the threads earlier. i wonder how other people feel who have the same thoughts and fears than me. is there someone here? or someone who got over it? who is free from them? how did you do it? i hear it's either never or you learn to live with it.  i don't care if i feel a little encumbered once a month. but that... i am so scared of giving up. sometimes i just want to catch a break. but that's just what gives my  thoughts a chance to grow again.  otherwise i am quite happy. i enjoy my work, like my colleagues and friends, i can follow my hobbies. my therapist doesn't judge me to be depressive or ever follow my thoughts, but the past three days i just doubted myself so greatly. even while writing this, i feel uneasy. yesterday i left my session with her feeling uneasy.  what do you all do to control them? i did so well over these two years, why am i suddenly like this again? (i can see myself being happy again once my period is over and my anxiety dwindles) but right now i feel like a wrack.  i'll try valerian for now, see if it calms me down a little. she also said thc products might help, anything natural for now, herbal things. she said if it helps to talk to someone who cares. it does help but it also leaves me uneasy.  i don't wanna die. i don't plan on listening to my thoughts. but i am so scared i'll start getting weak and agree with them. because i wished i could get a break. i feel exhausted right now. the thoughts are fueling my anxiety, my anxiety is fueling my thoughts, and my thoughts tell me the only way to stop these thoughts is to listen to them. isn't that dumb? why is it such an endless cycle for me?   anyway... i think this is all. my bad for making y'all read through my wall of text. i'd be glad to hear some other perspectives and stories. even if the symptoms and thoughts are different. maybe some comfort. maybe some tips. thank you for listening. i am uneasy right now but i hope some people are there and will listen to my story.",0,0

" thoughts that are really getting to me so might have ocd becausei get really obessess with my thoughts even though i hate them and don't like them. always have had them but since last year around november time been getting worse, sometimes i think a part of me is doing it for attention but the other half feels like i am going crazy. yes i ask myself questions and a little voice says yes when a no question is being answered. mainly i am focused on is the - am i cheating question, which for one i haven't been with my first boyfriend since may last year and is causing a problem at times these thoughts, at times cheating thoughts not me having the urges which yes i have thoughts of people just face wise in the past but i always feel guilty and tell him. i have never cheated and will never cheat but because every so often he says 'even though you are faithful to me, i sounds like you are cheating' even though he knows i am fully faithful to him and barely leave the house unless got college, going to either parents houses or his house. i have always feared someone cheating on me, never have i ever thoughts of me questioning myself and worried that my boyfriend will think that me act on it, even though promised and is against what i want. i want him and only him, no one else. i know worrying follows in the family but this, this is more than worrying because my main focus is that i want to spend the rest of my life with him, but at times he has mentioned that this could tear our relationship apart and yes he has thought of breaking up with me because i feel like i can't control my thoughts, no matter what he says, i feel so weak that i myself can't do this on my own.   yes i have some mental health problems which doesn't help, not diagnosed with anything but if you stay in a room with me for an hour you will notice if i fully act like myself instead of the pretendness of a mask i put up in front of people yes i might be on the spectrum as well, people have said so many time throughout my life but ignored it  why do i get obsessed with these thoughts? ( the questions of - am i cheating, which no i am not and will never do so, because i know and believe it is wrong, i want to be with my boyfriend for like. even though i am not religious,  my family are catholic and always taught me in life what is right or wrong. i found my life partner and its him but i am scared that i might lose him, he is my world and he is my everything)   i really need help, i tried to look for therapy but cost money even signed up recently for an nhs one but said will answer back in 20 days, which with my age, i believe i won't be able to get it for free, so if not, i am out of options. tried online therapy, all have memberships or you have to atleast pay for something, i am unemployed and don't have money to spare, i am an adult who still lives with her parents and my boyfriend can't get a job either, he is struggling in that area of finding one too, plus with college on hand especially next year  i just hate myself for it all, don't worry i ain't going to harm myself or anything (got reported once because someone thought that on this app i was on, to try to speak with others who are in similar situations)   yes i know there are people out there who are the same but at times, i feel alone and i can't always rely on my boyfriend, he has problems of his own both family life and depression wise too and i know i talking personal stuff over reddit, i don't care at this point and even if someone says you ain't alone, well i feel like that and i feel so alone and feel like i can't talk to anyone at all, like i am stuck in a see throu box and can't get out, as i watch people see me, try to talk to me but never able to get me out. is it weird to always feel like i am either suffocating or drowning, is that okay?  is it normal to be out of control especially out of control of your own mind?   because everyone labels everything in this day of age, at times we have to be careful on what we say or do, and yes technology weakness the mind and increases anxiety, eating disorders and more but we have to carry on with life and pretend everything is normal   well what is normal? i am not sure anymore",0,0

"don‚Äôt take disturbing /  thoughts as a sign that there‚Äôs something wrong with you - they‚Äôre more common than you think have you ever had an , unsettling thought pop into your head that just seemed to come out of nowhere? it may be fairly disturbing and you might feel like a bit of a freak or a weirdo as a result. well, guess what - you‚Äôre not!   /disturbing thoughts can take many forms - sometimes it can be based on fear (for example, the idea that you have a disease), anger (it might be a violent thought or a thought of self harm), inappropriate sexual thoughts, something around relationships or death. when they arrive they worry us, they can make us ask if there‚Äôs something wrong with us. its usually something that's fundamentally at odds with who we are, what we believe and what we want to do - for example the thought of jumping off when you‚Äôre near a cliff.  and this actually helps us to understand why we experience disturbing thoughts. many people (including me) experience the thought of jumping off when you‚Äôre near a cliff, but the  thought usually isn‚Äôt our mind trying to get us to act in a particular way, rather its our mind getting us to do the opposite. we‚Äôre afraid of doing something appropriate in public so we have a thought to do something inappropriate. we want to be safe from harm, so our mind asks us ‚Äúwhat would happen if you jumped off this cliff‚Äù - to get us to back away from the edge. they can also just be a random, meaningless stream of consciousness.  thoughts are common and not a sign that there‚Äôs something wrong with you.  we can choose to see these thoughts as just that - only thoughts. in fact,  or disturbing thoughts can be a helpful reminder that we are not our thoughts, they are simply something that we experience. we shouldn‚Äôt judge ourselves for having these thoughts, we shouldn‚Äôt try to fight with the thoughts or shut them out - that will only make them come more often and its where they draw their power from. instead, we can unlock the door, let them in and accept that they exist without judgement. sit with them for a moment. listen to what they have to say without agreeing or disagreeing and allow them to leave, which they inevitably do. if they come again, we can do the same thing. remember that trying to push them away is a form of attachment - we‚Äôre attached to the idea of being free of the thoughts and so we want to somehow purge them. unfortunately that's not how our brain works - in fact the resistance is likely to make the  thoughts come more often.  its also important not to let , disturbing thoughts feed into a pattern of consumption - unwanted thoughts can drive us to look for ways to distract ourselves. instead look at the fundamentals of your life; are you stressed out at the moment, are you spending more time alone than you usually do? are there changes you can make that contribute towards your calmness - can you do less of the things that you know increase your anxiety or sadness like caffeine or alcohol, more of the wholesome activities that develop your wellbeing like exercise, meditation and creative activities?  caveat - i'm not a mental health professional so do look for help from a therapist if  thoughts are disrupting your daily life and making it difficult to function.

"back with more pocd stuff is pocd is just an excuse for pedophilia? it seems like a weak, fake thing to distract myself away from the truth about myself.  what if the reason these thoughts do not go away is because i do have this sexual orientation?   why will these thoughts not go away?   why did i take pleasure when masturbating and a blurred image of a young girl appeared in my mind (this happened several times)? this felt very blissful. was it because i want that, was it because i was severely tormented and wanted out, thinking that doing so would end the thoughts somehow?  i've also masturbated to anger when my partner cheated on me (to get rid of it), shemales, men... you name it. but ultimately it seems i am only romantically and sexually interested in women my own age. but there there are these thoughts that creep in to say otherwise. and they don't go away.  why is it that i am not checking out young girls in the street, and only women my own age?  why is it i feel genital and body responses that could be interpreted as arousal when sometimes seeing younger girls, or even men? or animals... but saying these things i feel as though i am lying to myself, and the answer is pedophilia.  why do i respond to life in an anxious-lustful way?  sometimes i see a girl from a distance and think 'wow she's pretty' then i get closer and i think 'she's too young' (even if she's actually about 18-24)? this seems normal... even if they were younger. i have the same thing with men sometimes. i will check out a man i think is a woman, realize it's a man and then laugh. that is fine... but this whole pedo-themed thing is driving me crazy.  my head is totally fucked.  are these all just excuses for liking young girls? this is the crux of everything. this is what scares me the most and is what runs through my mind all day. when i sit alone it comes strongly. it feels as though this is the answer, and that everything else is false.  how can we actually know what is ocd and what isn't?  when i broke up with my girlfriend last year i had similar  thoughts about having to break up with her. my mind is now comparing these 2 truths... one of 'i need to break up with my partner' and 'i am repressing pedophilic sexual orientation'. this is how i am trying to ascertain correct internal discernment. i am trying to see if the truths feel the same.  i am on a journey of self discovery and this just keeps showing itself so strongly. i'm kind of losing my mind. what the fuck is this and how does it fit into my life?  i have a therapist...  someone say something lol.",0,0

"about  thoughts and ocd! something i‚Äôd like to share so i‚Äôve recently come across certain data that could maybe help those suffering with ocd/ thoughts‚Ä¶ or ocd involving fears of developing things like psychosis, schizophrenia‚Ä¶ etc.  anyways here‚Äôs some other ways  thoughts can show up from a study i found!    ‚Äúin the new study, the researchers asked people with ocd to answer a questionnaire designed to understand the strength of sensory obsessions in quantifiable terms.  they found that people who had more difficulty controlling their compulsions also tended to have stronger sensory elements related to their obsessions, compared with those who had less difficulty controlling compulsions. this seemed particularly true of people whose obsessions focused on cleanliness and personal contamination, the study found.  in general, the study found that strong sensory components to obsessions also appeared more often in people with all-around vivid imaginations.  a large group of patients with ocd turned out to experience their  thoughts as auditory ‚Äî arriving as whispered, spoken or shouted voices. that group of patients also tended to experience their normal thoughts as ""louder"" than most people do.  the researchers wrote that the study offers more evidence that the link between sensations and ocd has a lot of potential for treatment. if strong sensations make ocd symptoms more difficult to control, perhaps treatments based on redirecting those sensations ‚Äî which are already in the early phases of research ‚Äî could help patients better control their compulsions.‚Äù",0,0

"cephalopod master race there's a cephalopod master race living in our oceans, they have evolved with cloaking abilities and have researched cloaking for thousands and thousands of years living underwater, and that's the reason why we never see them. it's not hard to believe that a species could have developed similarly to humans underwater in the 3.4 billion years the earth has been around. they're smart, have hands to use tools, and vast oceans. i think we're only see the ""dumb"" ones in our oceans just like there's old world monkeys and wild monkeys on land. they are the reason behind ufo's. the resistance in water is much greater underwater, so when the crafts come above ground they travel much much faster due to less resistance. it's it more likely we have an intelligent beings hiding in or vast oceans or somewhere in or gigantic universe, what's more likely?",0,0

" thoughts make me hurt myself to stop them so here's the thing, i have been having  thoughts ever since i was a little kid and it started escalating after i developed ptsd (also as a kid). i never really gave it much thought because i thought i was the only person who experiences them and i didn't even know they had a name to them at the time. i developed a habit of thinking that if i don't hurt myself immediately after having those thoughts they would come true, i don't hurt myself badly it's more like me pinching myself till it hurts (it must hurt and it has to be my thigh that gets that treatment or else my brain will think it's not affective) and then i'm like oh ok good and i'll most likely move on till another thought happens, rinse and repeat. it's not really debilitating because i grew up with this and tbh it's the least of my mental health worries but i thought i should get it off my chest and maybe find someone who would understand me and/or tell me what the fuck is going on.",0,0

"grief trauma replay in disturbing scenarios tw: child loss i have tried to see a therapist about this issue, before and recently, and oddly feel blown off. they would rather focus on ways to relieve my depression and an anxiety so far, and i have yet to find a trauma-therapy specialist accessible. i feel extremely creepy.  i have lost a baby before due to preterm labor, and had a very traumatic second trimester death. my best friends husband fell off a high rise in 2019, and then she followed him in 2020. i had to take my mom off of life support after she couldn't recover from a bad stroke she suffered at home alone last year.   so now i can't stop thinking about what would happen if anyone died. like how would they feel in certain scenarios, would i be able to save them, how my life or my children or their loved ones wud be affected.   i do this with people i really don't care for, and kind of just run through the potential benefits like if my crappy landlord died, what would happen to the tenants, if my spouses high conflict ex died, how would that affect my stepkid? i have no desire to hurt anyone, but it does play often in detail and i would it not to.   the worse one is, it happens with my loved ones too. more often, in fact. like not just oh, what would our lives be like if spouse died but what steps would i take financially, what would be the final thought in their head, what would most likely kill them and how much pain and fear would they experience?  most disturbingly, this happens with my living children.  i really absolutely cannot handle the stress of these. on top of this, i have immense guilt for even  having these thoughts. like, how would kiddo feel if he knew i had an uncontrollable picture of his demise in my brain while he's telling me about minecraft?",0,0

"i almost died yesterday, and i can't stop thinking about tl;dr: i can't stop thinking about how my limbs were nearly severed by a bred fighting dog  i was walking my dog in our neighborhood, and we almost got attacked by a dog. to set the scene: i live in a gated apartment complex in a bad part of town. the complex is on a side road, where on the other side of the road further down the way is a walkway that is between the aforementioned road and private properties, and between the walkway and the road is a row of skinny trees and other foliage that make it difficult to see past.  so if i'm standing on my side and looking towards the street, i see the curb, a wall of trees, a walkway, and chainlink fences with tarps draped over them as to obscure people looking into the yard; in that order  i've walked my dog on my side of this road before. it's not particularly dangerous during the day. there are some dogs who bark from the hidden backyards, but i don't think anything of it.  i never thought about those dogs until, yesterday afternoon, one appeared before me from the shroud  it was a mutt, brown in color. it's eyes were black. it was looking at me, i was looking at it. my fight or flight reflex triggered, and i chose fight. i was ready, bending my knees and arms extended in front. i was ready to yell at the dog, but not to scare it. i was prepared to embolster myself like some misplaced viking or kenshi that was readying themselves for a fight. i was fully intent that this would be a fight, and there would be no other option  i thought i was ready to defend myself and my sweet pet, bless her. so why am i not dog meat right now?  my wife came by with the car before the dog had time to lunge at me. i let my dog in first (she loves the car, this was no big ask) and i followed. the dog was turning around the car like a rodeo cowboy turns around a barrel, but we made it and only because my wife has impeccable timing  i keep replaying that in my head. i drove past where it happened. i looked up what to do in that situation for the future, and i literally checked all boxes of what *not* to do to de-escalate things  i keep thinking about how much harm could have befallen me and what could have happened to my dog had things played out the way things were playing out. i could hardly sleep last night thinking about it",0,0

"how to stop  thoughts? my  thoughts problem started at 2017, i remember that my first  thought was about god doesnt existing. dont get me wrong, i dont have any problems with atheist people, for instance, half my friends are atheist and we really dont bother each others beliefs, but the thing is, this disturbed me. it didnt really changed my belief in some kind of god, but the fear that those thoughts were the truth were haunting me, it was just the beggining. 2018, my  thoughts turned very nihilistic. i like philosophy, i am not going to lie, but i feel the difference when i am reflecting upon it and when it is a  thought. if i was analysing nihilism, i would be able to decide when i am thinking about it, and it wouldnt disturb me, when i had a  thought about nihilism, there is just anxiety related to it, an d every logic and rational thinking is throught out of the window. in 2020, i started to have  thoughts about free will, then about reality, then about our size compared to the size of the universe, and so on. i started to have  thoughts about my hobbies too. when i was reading, or writing, or watching a movie, the  thoughts would start to question if i really liked what i was doing, it was very annoying. most recently, i had  thoughts related to a book that i read. in one part of the book, the author classifies hobbies and other activities not considered essentials were harmful to us, bacause in the early days, humans were adapted to execute acctivities necessary to their survival. even tho i dont agree with that, and i have plenty of rational arguments against the author, it still here, as a  thought. my  thoughts are afraid that he is right and all my hobbies will not fullfill me any happiness. i am tired of it all, how can i stop my  thoughts?  &#x200b;  tl;dr i have  thoughts since 5 years ago, how can i stop it for good?",0,0

"i get  thoughts whenever i see something negative so let me just start off by saying i have never been diagnosed with ocd or any sort of mental health condition, but i've suspected that i have traits of it for a long time. i am not a violent or negative person, and i actually have a consistent fear of being a bad person. basically, i've recently been struggling with  thoughts whenever i encounter something negative. so basically, if i were to watch a documentary about a serial killer or like the tv show ""you"", there's always a voice in my head basically constantly saying ""would you ever do this? would you ever hurt someone? would you be capable of there horrible things?"", and i do know that these thoughts come from a fear of being a bad person or doing bad things, but i can't seem to silence them. i've done some research and have ready many things about saying that if you constantly try to silence this voice, it becomes louder and stronger, for example like the story about the white wolf and the black wolf. i'm aware  thoughts are normal for pretty much everyone, but it has come to a point where it has interrupted my day to day life. every time i watch a show about bad people, or i read a story or watch a documentary about people doing horrible things basically, the ""voice"" in my head keeps asking if i would ever do these things, or even start to encourage me to such things. i'm very clear that these are just  thoughts and not urges, but i have a constant fear that if they remain in my head too long that they'll start to actually drive me insane. recently they've calmed down a bit, but they're still there. i just want to go back to thinking normally and positively lol. theres also a person in my life that has done something really horrible to me when i was just a little kid, but they were considered a ""good person"" to everyone else, which i think sparked this fear of being a bad person or doing bad things. anyone have any advice on how to cope with this or have any inspiring stories that will help me out here?",0,0

"looking for tips that have worked for you guys hi everyone, i'm new here, so i'm sorry if it's been asked before. i've always had trouble calming my mind down, even on my add medication. it helps, but only so far. if i don't take my medication, they're almost unbearable. but, i'm working on it.   not to get too into the specifics, i'm just going through a rough time and can't get the  thoughts to go away. i'm still able to distinguish how i'm making up worst case scenarios and stories for every tiny detail and knowing i'm doing it. that helps, but doesn't stop them. my therapist also recommended some self loving kindness meditation and start exercising again, which has been a tremendous help! the medication has helped me gain the tools to bring myself back to the moment when my mind becomes exhausted.   as the day goes on, things get a little easier (still can't stop them completely), but the mornings have been as awful as when these problems arose. well, a little better. last week was the first time, in my life, that i considered hurting myself, but was able to get ahold of my therapist. i tried the suicide hotline, but after being on hold i just hung up. again, i'm not close to that dark feeling, but i felt it might be informative.   anyone have any other tips or coping skills for the morning? i haven't tried working out in the mornings because i have 2 toddlers who are *very* early risers. it isn't impossible, just difficult enough to want to consider other options first. thank you if you got this far!",0,0

"stuck in daydreams/mentally fucked/lonely when i have the option of being alone, i sometimes go into this dream world where usually it's people who i've known for a very long time or not at all. they view me as the person that i want to be(social, funny, hot as fuck) but i'm not. people who have left my life .. girlfriends and friends who haven't seen me in more than a year or two will be having a drink with me on this delusional world and my mind actually constructs conversations between myself and these people and it goes so deep in, my body laughs or cries or feels mentally euphoric or sad, depending on what and who i'm thinking about. this means happy and sad chemicals are being released into my brain for thinking about unreal situations.  everybody has cute little scenarios in their heads with their crush or friends but i sometimes even have these scenarios where i lose my dad or mom or brother...or even some of my closest friends and how i'll have the attention on me at their funeral and how i'll act and behave im afraid feeling good out of these scenarios will over a period of time sort of pave this path in my brain that only gives me happiness in these unrealistic situations whereas i get nothing off of the real world. i have irregular sleep cycles. i don't take care of my physical or mental health. i don't know how to socially interact with people...i'm not a loner i have friends but sometimes i just don't know how to talk to people and i seem boring. i made a few mistakes in my life and i'm only 20. after lockdown when i travelled to another state my girlfriend/bestfriend/complicated told me she never wants to talk to me ever again and she cut me out of her life and my bestfriends took her side. i lost seven of my closest friends before moving to a new state. i regarded them closer than my family and i still think about them every day in my head but it's sad because ik they don't think about me. i miss them.

"starting to hate my family small noises, mostly hearing my family talk (my mom and dad talk to each other fairly loud, they just have naturally loud voices) and hearing my dad play video games (wearing headphones and speaking to players, my sister also does this bc she plays video games too) are my biggest triggers for  thoughts. hearing them talk while im reading or trying to concentrate on something makes me automatically think of harming them which i would never neverrrr do. these  thoughts have manifested into actual hateful feelings towards them and it is making me a rotten person inside. i have school during the day and listen to music or go out after the school day to avoid these thoughts about them further but before i go to sleep or in the evening i usually read and a different type of  thought makes me focus on any little noise that could possibly distract me from reading so naturally it focuses on other people in the house i can hear talking. this  thought (the one that focuses on little noises) has been only going on for a few months after i found out that small noises are amplified for people with autism (something that i am getting tested for). so basically i had close to zero problems with small noises then suddenly after the lady who is testing me for autism brings up the fact that small noises upset people with autism my brain makes me have a problem with small noises!?? faker muchüòíalso this triggered another problem i have with my parents. since my ed began (approx 2 years ago) i have had  hateful thoughts when i hear/ see them eat. it makes me put all of the blame of my ed on them (which is not true) and basically triggers the same hateful violent thoughts.

"w around 6 months into the pandemic, while approaching election time one of my neighbors began to display outrageous amounts of trump merchandise and propaganda.

"request for feedback with pocd/ocd thinking process from success stories hey...  i am currently struggling with pocd. it's been about 2 years now (my other posts explain more, i wrote a very recent one here too). i have a therapist and am in the process of opening up to the people around me. quite scary because 30-40% of me still says there is a chance i'm a pedofile but that's the nature of this thing i guess. and shit how shameful, embarrassing etc  i was just wondering if anyone can share any insight into their own process? i'm looking for successful stories of going through this and then getting out. i'm talking freedom from this totally.  all i ever see if people trapped! i assume that's because when free we don't want to sit on the internet... we want to live.  so if anyone did want to share what they did, how they faced this and ended it etc it would be really inspiring for me to read about, and i'm sure others too.  this is the most relentless thing ever! it's as though the seed of 'i'm a pedofile' has been planted into me and i have to become that to be free.",0,0

"pocd is endless... 2 years. i feel like it's destroying me... and actually it might just be true. life is very strange. i'm 31 and this is not how i expected things to be...  2 years ago (you can see old posts from where i was freaking out if you are interested) i went into memories of when i touched a family member when i was about 13. she was 10 years younger than me... fully clothed, on her backside.   therapists, friends and an ex-partner told me it was nothing. why make a big deal out of it? etc... i mean i still feel awful about it regardless of what it was as it was non-consensual and i just kind of did it. but that's another story.  going into it all exploded thoughts of being a pedofile. it peaked within the first few months where i was rotating around suicidal thoughts all day. i also seemed to sexualize everything... i could feel orgasmic feelings in my body when thinking of family members, men, women, animals, trees, sounds etc. it was actually kind of like a super power (i'm not talking about fantasizing about others - i actually stopped watching porn and creating sexual fantasies a few months before this started). i didn't really take too much of it seriously and did kind of see how i was just creating a feeling in my body, regardless of what i saw or not. i mean imagine just sitting somewhere boring like a meeting and tuning into orgasmic feelings in your body with no content. life was very interesting.   but there was honestly no limit. i had no problem with any of that, but children just made me feel like complete scum.   here's an example of what would happen... i would walk down the street and see a woman with a child. i would feel fear and anxiety. constantly analysing... do i find her attractive, do i find the child attractive etc? all with the groinal response i've read about, maybe images in my mind and/or thoughts. the same would happen with animals. my eyes would go to the genitals, and then sexual feelings, thoughts etc.  and always (no matter the content) my thoughts, images etc would always be pleasurable. i could and would always feel nice feelings in my body with any type of thought. the other day i looked at a photo of a serial killer (a fat ugly one...) and felt my genitals tingling. you see how confusing this is? it's as though there is this pull towards very dark, taboo and bad things. but in reality i have never and have no intention of hurting anyone or engaging in those things. it's possibly some kind of fear of those things existing in me... i'm not sure.   a few times during masturbation, blurred images/thoughts (the ones that used to run through my mind a lot of the time about children) appeared and, although i was totally disgusted with myself, it actually felt really good. some part of me says i actually like that, another part says it is relief from constant stress of those types of thoughts, another says it is something to do with taboo... related to this are the ideas of what can separate me from society... whatever is the worst and just not the exact societal norm.  my mind always goes to these. not to offend anyone but i am speaking in terms of the vanilla civilian (lol). so i feel instability in my personality when there is talk about gay people, racists, transvestites, pedophiles, murderers, rapists etc... people who repress things and then discover them, or people who are living some kind of secret life as something bad, or just something that doesn't fit the person's idea of how they think they should be in the world. i think you get the idea. it's always the thought of 'that could be me... i could be that'.  sometimes in a large group of people; if you were to say all of those examples one after the other, with gaps in between each... i bet that i would turn red and feel anxious at each one, then turn back to normal colour in the gaps lol. it's strange.  i've honestly been through psychological hell during these past 2 years with other crazy stuff happening on top of this that i won't go into, but i'm mentioning it because that 'stuff' is kind of over and now this has returned with more force.  i have another therapist now i'm working with. the problem for me is that this comes on really strong... then it goes away. i sometimes admit out loud 'i am a pedofile' etc and say all the thoughts on my mind. then it goes away and the whole thing feels silly.  i've even totally broken this 'pattern' where the whole id'ing myself as some kind of sexual pervert or abuser lost its power. it faded away along with the idea that there was something wrong with me. but i'm not there now. i'm deep in this pedo shit and honestly kind of have no idea how to get out. is there some kind of attraction there? how the hell do i tell? what are my true orientations, and what is mentally created?  there is definitely a difference from when i see an attractive woman in the street, to a little girl but i really can't seem to shake this. i know it's impossible to tell from a single post online but could anyone share any thoughts? is it possible that i could be repressing some kind of attraction to young girls? am i just mentally ill from holding this for so long?  my inward & outward orientation has become much more self-centered and hating throughout this time too. not great. working on that a lot but it seems i am very far from real emotions or human connection. it's like i am extraditing myself from life. sometimes i do think about suicide. i don't see anything else for myself. how the hell could this have happened, and why?

"suggestions, is this more than gad? tldr, i'm a nervous wreck, start a new job soon and need help.  hi all, sorry if i'm doing this wrong, this is my first time using reddit although i often end up here. let me just start by saying i have severe anxiety, to the point where it's debilitating sometimes. like sometimes when i have an out of the blue panic attack, i can't hear someone two feet away from me because my ears are ringing and i'm starting to black out (i've never felt like i'm dying).  in wondering if i may be suffering from more than gad, i've recently stumbled across the term  thoughts as well as thought broadcasting and the last few doctors i've gone to haven't been able to diagnose me with anything other than gad and given me bullshit meds that don't work.   examples of what i deal with regularly: ‚Ä¢ fear that someone is going to harm me while out in public (getting robbed or stabbed, or a drive-by) ‚Ä¢ when working in an office and someone walks by, i feel like i might inappropriately grab them and take days to convince myself i didn't (mostly men) ‚Ä¢ worried during meetings in person and online i said something and not sure if i actually did or not (yelling out inappropriate things) ‚Ä¢ scared to hold eye contact because i don't want it to be viewed as sexual, looking at someone's lips by mistake can send me into a full blown panic attack (this mostly happens with men) ‚Ä¢ when i'm two floors up, i think i can hear people in my house visiting my boyfriend talking shit about me (yes they're actually there) ‚Ä¢ when i'm around someone who has the same interests as me and then someone who knows that person starts talking to them about said interests, i feel like i'm the one being talked about  ‚Ä¢ tmi but say for instance i masturbated on my lunch break (at home), i feel like everyone knows when i go back to work  ‚Ä¢ if i think uncomfortable thoughts, sometimes i think people know what i'm thinking even though i know that's not true ‚Ä¢ i have guilt about things i've done that no one knows about from a decade ago, yet when someone is joking or discussing related topics i feel like they're talking about me specifically and know ‚Ä¢ i get incredibly uncomfortable if i think someone thinks i'm attracted to them in the workplace, even though i don't ‚Ä¢ laughing too hard or being out of breath can make me go into a panic attack because i forget why i'm laughing sometimes which makes me start creating memories of things that didn't even happen ‚Ä¢ the week before my period i'm a nervous wreck and all these symptoms are 10 fold ‚Ä¢ i get stressed out if i have to do anything on a sunday because it's the end of the weekend and i have to mentally prepare for the following week for atleast a full day (mentally) ‚Ä¢ most symptoms get worse the better i get to know someone - for instance, i quit my last job after a year of mostly being okay (work from home), then all of a sudden one day this guy i worked with (hardly interacted with him at all and a nice person) started sending me into full blown panic attacks. when he would speak during meetings, my whole body would go cold and i couldn't hear him, then my face starts blushing and i'm worried if other people notice and then i get anxiety that everyone knows i'm having a panic attack. and this happened everytime i interacted with him or if someone else mentioned his name to me even if he wasn't a part of the convo. he never did anything to make me uncomfortable. during my days off, i would spend the majority of my days thinking about how not to think about this person and be bother by them. this happened about 3-4 months into my previous job as well.   i'm sure there's more i'm forgetting but i've been dealing with this for about 15 years now. some days are better than others, some days are pure hell. i'm starting a new job next week and i'm currently not on any medications and i'm so scared. i have to go into the office for a week or two of training and then into the office once a week. i've quit jobs before due to anxiety and have been working as a va for a bit now to avoid going into an office but i'm high key panicking and i know i need this job if i don't want to be broke after the next year. but this health issue screws up everything for me all of the time.  i've done tons of research and i keep coming across different mental illnesses that i semi relate to but not quite. does anyone have the same symptoms as me and a proper diagnosis? i need to get this fixed as it's ruining my life and every doctor/psychologist i've gone to just tells me to exercise (i do everyday), get blood work done (i'm healthy, no thyroid issues), and take anti psychotics (don't work, they hurt my head and give me anxiety).   i am very fortunate to have a loving partner that tries his hardest to understand and be patient with me, we have a nice home together and two kitties, and i fear one day i will lose everything because i can't hold a job for more than a year. i'm almost 29 and need to get my shit together and if doctors can't help me, i need to help push them in the right direction i guess. i don't know what to do anymore, i feel like these issues require medical attention and i just keep getting blown off. i also used to do drugs and have attempted suicide several times as an adult and i feel that's part of the reasons doctors won't bother with me.   what can i do, i feel so stuck, what are some things that have helped you - does anyone relate to any of this or am i so fucked up that no one can help me?",0,0
"i keep letting  thoughts prevent me from doing things. any advice on how to stop? over the last few years, i have been really focused on existential facts like i only have one life and i can‚Äôt re-do moments. whatever happens is what happens. i want to live as good as a life as possible and i want to know that i was a good and moral person when i get to the end of my life. so it really stresses me out when i have  thoughts that i find distressing. there have been at least two times when i wanted to start up a conversation with a girl i didn‚Äôt know but i didn‚Äôt because i had a distressing  thought. i get scared in the moment of letting that  thought define that potential conversation that i don‚Äôt end up initiating that conversation. i now regret not taking those opportunities. sometimes i want to buy things but i don‚Äôt because then i have a  thought and don‚Äôt want to have those things ‚Äútainted‚Äù by it. i‚Äôm tired of letting those  thoughts control me so much. any advice?",0,0

"i feel that i'm becoming more psychotic. i think about killing people a lot. not in the simple, angry, or crime of passion way, but cold blooded murder. about butchering people and putting them on display like art pieces. i think about it and i like it, i feel genuine, almost giddy excitement and joy, from imagining a man with an axe in his head, that i planted there myself. just saying ""kill"" feels good. i do not feel sympathy towards anyone. but i can see out of others' eyes, feel what they feel, i can offer advice regarding social conflicts even though i do not care or relate to them in any way. i dont know what i am or what i'm capable of, but i know that its not normal. i'm not sure what to do about it so i'm just gonna bide my time and refrain from killing anyone in the meantime.",0,0

randomly started getting sexual  thoughts about people around me. family friends strangers or even people on tv. what can i do? i can tell you i 100% don‚Äôt wanna act on the thoughts and it actually makes me feel horrible as a person for having these thoughts but i don‚Äôt know how to get them to go away. it‚Äôs been 3 days (which i know isn‚Äôt long) of this and it‚Äôs eating me up. i try to ignore them and just keep doing what i‚Äôm doing (like watching tv) but then i‚Äôm the back of my head i‚Äôll get a sexual thought about who‚Äôs on tv which is what i‚Äôm trying to watch to ignore the thoughts.  i also wanted to comment that i have health issues currently and have been a bit upset over the health issues and whatnot and scared and anxious if i‚Äôll get better. my doctor thinks i have low serotonin levels and when i look into it the internet says low serotonin levels can cause these kind of  thoughts. i‚Äôm wondering is that true? does anyone know can low serotonin actually cause  thoughts and can fixing the serotonin level help to rid the thoughts? like i said i‚Äôve only been having these thoughts 3 days now but it‚Äôs all the time and then i feel like shit for having the thoughts.   does anyone know if taking 5htp and gaba for low serotonin could help with  thoughts? are there any other recommendations on things to do to get them to go away for good? any advice would be nice thanks! this sucks. i had previously been feeling suicidal a bit over my health issues back when i didn‚Äôt think i was gonna get better and was just suffering but now i‚Äôm hopefully getting better slowly and i recently stopped wanting to die cause of my health issues but then bam now i feel like i shouldn‚Äôt live because of these stupid thoughts i‚Äôm having.,0,0

"""you know what would be fun right about now? drug use and binge drinking!"" this is going to be a hell of a topic to talk to my therapist about, assuming i don't chicken out.   i wouldn't say i had a huge issue with alcohol years ago, having a few drinks a year at best unless i wanted to treat myself to a jack or rum and coke once or twice a month. i don't think i'd really start to amp up by having one or two late at night after having an argument with my partner or getting triggered over something else.   the same goes for drugs, which for me was benzos when i was abruptly yanked off them without tapering down from what i remember. that was close to ten years ago, and fuck, part of me still misses them even though i never used recreationally - but i admitted to being tempted. i remember telling someone this and they said that when we were going to tend to an out of state family emergency, they knew someone who could possibly hook me up. it was very hard to resist the temptation, but i ultimately did. however, this is the same person who got mad at me years later for talking about admitting to myself that i might have a problem if i miss them that much - again, even though years earlier they were okay with enabling me.  now my life is in the shitter and it's hard to not get into that head space of wanting to use to manage my stress. i already told a friend years ago that i'd more than likely do it if i had no personal obligations and i lived on my own. i've recently opened up about it to some others and they've been supportive in whatever way they can. but now i'm afraid to bring it up again since i completely forgot that i'd drink late at night and how that's going to look on me. like, damn. what the hell did i get myself into?",0,0

"slicing heads like pizza this is related to anger management upbringing and  thoughts is how my brain cope with hiding anger.   for as long as i can remember, i‚Äôve always coped with anger by looking at the situation inside of my head. i imagine that i hurt the people that i‚Äôm angry at in that moment. the thoughts first took form as a simple cursing, curse words. then it developed; i see myself stabbing them, slicing their throats open. hammering a nail inside of them, slicing their heads like they‚Äôre pizza. a quick reminder: this all took place inside of my head. i realistically can‚Äôt see myself actually performing it, nor that i have the guts and immorality to do so. for as long as i can remember, the development started when i was 14. it definitely has been occurring beforehand, just not in that form of hurting people (by slicing them, as mentioned). i never wanted to think like that, i cant seem to help my thoughts.   i‚Äôm the eldest child. growing up, my parents have little to no knowledge about handling children‚Äôs issues and how to guide them. so whenever i get angry, they always get mad at me, and it always ends in myself apologizing to them. i never knew that i could express anger, even with excitement they only say that i‚Äôm being dramatic.  i didn‚Äôt know that my emotions were invalidated, but i‚Äôve always thought of how unfair it was, how they‚Äôre allowed to express anger and i am not.  and me, having two younger siblings, pressured to be ‚Äúan example‚Äù to them, that i have to take care of them. my first ‚Äúduty‚Äù as the eldest was that i have to prepare my sister‚Äôs school uniform and her school books every day of the week. that made me angrier. i was 8 at that moment, having no guidance on studies, schedule management, how to face issues and solve problems of my own, parents busy with parenting their other kids. i flunked elementary school.   i was 9 when i got sa by one of my neighbors, they took my stockings off in front of the neighborhood‚Äôs field where everyone was playing basketball and such. dad was angry, not at them but at me. he screamed at me to call mom about what just happened. i got grounded and wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave the house for the next few months. he created a schedule timetable of how i should live for the next days.  i wasn‚Äôt angry nor that i felt sad, i was confused. what is it that i do wrong?  that reminds me, there was also a time where i would play with the kids in my neighborhood, i went to a short gathering with them, like a barbecue party. there was a feud between my parents and theirs that i knew nothing about. when my parents found out, they dragged me out and brought me home. i was angry, i just wanted to play with my friends. my grandma came and thought that i was possessed, (she‚Äôs religious lol)  im sorry for being so out of the topic and for venting, but i hope that‚Äôll illustrate some of the anger that i stored throughout my life.   back to the topic, i started to hide my emotions, it felt like i was tip toe-ing around everyone i came across. in my mind, i have to treat them like they‚Äôre glass.   i know and acknowledge that i should be the one fixing all this mess up. im the one who have control over myself, so im the one to blame of how think. i know that the thoughts that came to mind was resulted by all those years of storing ill emotions. i want to stop thinking this way, to express my anger, but i still want to maintain the reserved persona. i don‚Äôt know where to start, i don‚Äôt even know if i can start.",0,0

"obsessions and ruminations about getting revenge on ex-bff. i had a friendship all through high school that when i look back at these days, i can see was extremely toxic.   this best friend of mine was fiercely competitive. she used ro make back-handed remarks about my appearance and personality to raise her own self esteem. she was obsessed with presenting as a chill, no drama, ""pure"" person who never had a bad thought about anyone, even while manipulating me and causing me grief. she would want me to cut off ties with friends so that we could get closer, but ultimately it was her who walked away from the friendship when we started university. the list goes on and on. but tl;dr, she was an all-round manipulative, jealous and fake person and i was affected deeply by this.  it's been nearly 6 years since we last spoke and i'm still not coping. i have vivid dreams of her, sometimes of her apologising for ghosting me and being shitty, but often of her doing well and achieving goals while i fail at the task at hand.   i've tried to get in touch via facebook but she has her messenger set to ""only friends can message me"", because she has always had to have the last word - even when life is treating her just fine. so i cannot contact her and vent.   last night i had a dream of stabbing her. i often daydream about beating her up even though i know i'd get sent to prison.  i've seen her around town about twice since she we cut contact and she has run off, avoiding eye contact. i get such a rush at the thought of chasing her up the street and breaking her nose.  she knows how much she has hurt me, and i want to make her pay. i have spoken to friends and therapists about this but absolutely no one understands my obsession. they tell me to let it go but it's not that easy. they're worried about me. i'm worried about me.   dae struggle with this, or something similar? any contributions are welcome.",0,0

"( nsfw ) can't stop thinking about my behavior at the gym hey. i'm a 25 year old autistic man. as part of my neurodiverse social group, i started going to the gym. i had a great time. i enjoyed the workout but i also enjoyed the women in tight shorts that were around me, especially the one who looks like kate micucci who was wearing headphones. the other day, i made a post asking for advice on how to approach her without being creepy and most of the comments i got were from women telling me that if i want to approach her in that environment, that makes me a creep. some of them also said that i should say hi to everyone so that it's not too unusual when i say to hi to her. right now, i'm thinking about just focusing more on the workout and leaving everyone alone. i feel shame about the way that i looked at those women, and i was advised in another post to use that as a reminder to not look at them again. right now, i'm not asking for advice on what to do in the gym. instead, i'm asking for advice on how to make these  thoughts go away, if possible.",0,0

"been struggling a lot with anxiety  thoughts and don't know how to stop them they started out a while ago, basically i just keep having  thoughts about imaginary situations that anger and stress me out, they involve things like me living with abusive parents and the situations that come with that, or me being accidentally rude to people and hurting their feelings, and a lot more, most of these thoughts come from things that i don't like, like child abuse and social anxiety  these thoughts have been severely effecting me and my parents   when i have a thought i always get really mad due to the contents of the thoughts and how i would hate to be in that situation, so when i experience a thought i have a physical reaction, like making a sudden movement, or saying something to myself like ""shut up"" or ""okay that's enough i'm gonna go drink water now"" and then not doing that , all of these end up concerning my parents a lot, because i look like i'm going crazy when i just randomly spit out something like ""okay leave me alone"" when i am alone in my room  but that's just the easy part, i always have thoughts about arguing with people about stuff, and i always end up arguing with them in real life too, as in i would be experiencing a thought in my brain, and i would physically speak to myself in real life with the thoughts and argue with them, and this also has scared my family a lot, because i would just be sitting there sometimes even with them in the car, and i'd just start talking to myself angrily  2 days ago i was sitting in my room and drawing i was having some extremely uncomfortable  thoughts and i just couldn't take it anymore so i stood up and screamed from the top of my lungs, witch terrified my parents and made my mother cry  and i don't know what to do now, i already went to therapy last year for a possible ocd diagnosis and took erp but at the end therapist said i didn't have it, i wanna go there again but my parents won't let me because they don't want me to think i have another disorder  i tried looking up stuff online, the most common way to stop anxiety  thoughts is through ignoring the thought and not engaging with it and essentially desensitizing yourself to it, but i simply cannot stop engaging and arguing with these thoughts without zoning out and forgetting about it , i heard that maybe trying to ignore them for a certain time, like 30 minutes for example would help but i am yet to try that  like i don't know what to do now, i have to study but i can't do that properly, and sometimes i can't even pay attention in class, and my parents are losing their minds and it's effecting their physical health too, maybe i should look up more reddit threads of poeple instead of youtube videos about  thoughts?",0,0

"morbid ideas i wanted to ask you what is the more evil action.  i shall give a somewhat detailed description of the situation, you must think about it and i‚Äôll add my own opinion at the end.    i was thinking, i am a man so if i were to commit a violent crime, it probably would have to involve rape, because why not if the opportunity is there anyways.  so i was thinking if in the middle of the night, break into a home where i know a mother, father, daughter, son.  the kids being around 10 or 11, the parents still young and attractive.  i would of course kill the father as he‚Äôs of no use and the biggest physical threat.  i can‚Äôt shoot as it would wake the kids and alert neighbors.  i would have to slice his throat, i know once doesn‚Äôt guarantee death so i guess i would keep dragging the blade across a dozen times.  she would be held down and mouth covered, told to stay quiet or i‚Äôll kill the kids.  i would then cover her mouth with tape and strip her clothes off, i wouldn‚Äôt hurt her at that moment.  before the kids come in i would touch her and maybe stick my fingers in her.  then i would sneak into the kids room and scare them enough to where they stayed silent.  then i bring them in with the mother.    1: i rape the son, daughter, and mother.  then kill the kids first.    2: i rape the mother first and kill her in front of the kids.    both scenarios everyone dies.  i choose 1 as the mother has more of a connection to her kids, more emotional development.  the kids would probably just cry since they can‚Äôt fully understand the situation.  she would break completely and i could probably just leave.    thank you for your time, this is important. ps i‚Äôm a pretty good dude",0,0

"disturbing thoughts about hurting myself and others i (20f) feel like i'm losing my mind. about a month ago i started getting  thoughts about hurting myself and others. i've never had them before. whenever i'm in the kitchen near the knives i get an urge to take a knife and stab myself in the stomach or stab my eyes out. in class i feel an urge to scream when it's silent. it feels like i can just barely stop myself. when i wait for the train i feel an extreme urge to push somebody or to jump in front of the train myself. one day it was so bad it felt like my legs were about to start running towards the train any second. i had to grip the wall to atleast somehow stop myself. i get thoughts about poisoning my family and have an urge to drink dozens of pills at a time. i think about ripping my eyes out and cutting my limbs off. because of the stress of rotating through these thoughts everyday for months, i've also been going through a lot of depersonalization/derealization. i feel like i'm on a movie set, a sims character mindlessly existing. i had to touch my bed the other day to make sure it was real and even though i could feel it i still couldn't convince myself that i'm not in a simulation and i almost had a full blown panic attack. at one point i was convinced that my mom was evil when she would look at me. it was something about her eyes. today my newest urge has been literally doing black magic on people to kill them which is fucking insane. i don't know how to make the thoughts stop. i've read a lot about ocd but the  thoughts are described as thinking something you'd never actually do. my thoughts feel like urges the more i think about them so i don't know if this would be characterized as ocd. i do have a history of ocd though. specifically, drawing specific images and letters in my head over and over, checking and rechecking until i'm satisfied, touching things a specific amount of times, etc. i realize i need therapy but i'm scared i'm going to get taken to a psych ward as suicidal and homicidal ideation are both reasons for therapists to report in the u.s. any advice or commentary you could give would be highly appreciated. thank you guys. i'm really struggling.",0,0

"how to deal with  thoughts without a therapist? so, i've been having really bad anxiety inducing  thoughts. it's always the same basic thing with a different spin. i am disabled and i can't work or get disability because i am ""too young"" and my disease isn't well known or accepted as enough to not be able to work. so therapy is not an option for me. thing is, my  thoughts (mixed with cptsd) are making my health worst because of how stressful they are.  tw: graphic violence, psychological torture.  it started when someone ""catfish me"" (idk if it's the appropriate term) and made me believe i knew members my favorite band and that they were their biological family. things got mixed up with supernatural stuff and i felt for it because i grew up with a mom that believed in that stuff, i was naive and an impressionable teen. it was not so bad at the biggening but at some point, the person made me believe they were getting kidnapped and tortured and i would talk with the characters they created to find a way to get them out of whatever horrible trouble they were in. it was a pretty regular thing and i started constantly having  thoughts about all that could happen to them and thinking about all the ways i could possibly offer help/ solve the problems to keep 'em safe. other characters started to also get kidnaped and tortured including one of em who i considered my best friend. at some point he was trapped in a wooden box who would fill up with water slowly as i was texting him and well, he ended up telling me the water was too high and stopped texting me for a while. i freaked out and texted him a bunch. another character texted me telling me he was safe now. (the person who made up the story told me they actually wanted to kill him but that they saw my reaction and changed their mind). i realized not long after that the person who catfish me was catfishing me and that the characters weren't real, but it was also making 4 years, i would text some of the characters daily, so it took me a while to confront them. the initial reaction was ""i'm hurt you think i 'm not real"" so i stopped but i confronted them again a few months after and they admitted what they did.      now i keep on having  thoughts about people i love dying or getting hurt, i think i've got harm ocd and i keep on having daily hours long  thoughts about meeting the actual band and telling them about it and getting to be friends. i actually wrote a long letter to them talking about this minus the supernatural part that i don't touch in this post, and it didn't help much (except to stop drinking and cut off contact with the catfisher). i feel trapped in a loop since years, and i feel like i am going mad, and i am getting more and more health problems. any advice would be great...",0,0

idk what to do so i have a brother that‚Äôs 11 years older than me. one time when i was younger (like 10 or something) it was just me and my brother at home. i walked through the kitchen and i saw a knife sitting on the counter for a split second i seriously thought about taking that knife and then stabbing him to death.  now i‚Äôm an adult and my brother died like a year and a half ago (he got hit by a drunk driver). i have like medium? bad ocd and my  thoughts keep telling me that it‚Äôs my fault my brother died. that i wanted him dead and that‚Äôs why he died.  but then again what if it was just the  thoughts all along? what if it was them telling me to kill my brother?  i don‚Äôt know what to do. i‚Äôve never told anyone about this because i‚Äôm afraid of what they‚Äôll think of me. but at the same time the  thoughts are killing me and i just need to get this off my chest. idk i‚Äôm just hoping that telling some strangers on the internet will at least help a little bit.,0,0

"guilty conscience almost 6 years ago, i ghosted a guy i used to talk to everyday for months because of my then boyfriend. no explanation nothing. he was a nice guy who didn‚Äôt do anything to me personally but what we shared wasn‚Äôt healthy (unintentionally supportive of bad habits, people pleasing etc ). ever since then whenever i would see something like a meme that remind me of them i would feel guilty. it got repetitive and i didn‚Äôt like how often i remembered him because i didn‚Äôt want to. normally it wouldn‚Äôt mean anything. but because of the guilt, the thoughts became to mean something. i would keep rationalizing and pushing it away. but it keeps coming back. it‚Äôs kind of like not having given him closure and stuff. guilty conscience. anyways these thoughts would later change to like liking the things he would do for me and stuff like that. i really didn‚Äôt, and i haven‚Äôt felt like that about him. so it made me uncomfortable to think so and even more so at the thought of confronting him. four years passed and theoughts were still as bad, now i got  throughts about other people and things tooo. so at some point i msged him saying sorry and all and that it‚Äôs for the best. i didn‚Äôt feel anything when i msged him nor when he replied. my thoughts were not true. however the thoughts i had now had several paths. a while after i finished the conversation i got a thought that said maybe you liked what he said. and the cycle went on. now the guilt of closure was gone but the guilt of the thoughts remained. till today it doesn‚Äôt go away and i find myself thinking what if it‚Äôs true. i know it‚Äôs not. i‚Äôve had boyfriends i loved . i have one right now who i love more than anything in the world. yet these thoughts are so expansive and recurring. even when his name pops in i get anxiety. i just wanna never think of it again.",0,0

"thoughts of self harm uhg i just need to vent. i've had  thoughts for a long time, so i'm used to them, and i've always had thoughts of self harm or suicide. nothing that i would ever act on, i don't actually want to die or harm myself, and i've never done anything in the past either, but thoughts of it come and go in waves.   recently i started university and one of my classmates had a lot of scars on her arms and my brain instantly latched on to this and wanted me to cut myself on the arm. not the wrist but on a really weird spot on the arm. as usual i just brushed this off and went about my week as normal!  note that i'm also being treated for a possible personality disorder that carries with it periods of mania, which clouds my judgment and ability to think about consequences. my medicine to control this mania recently ran out and i've been out of refills, so my emotions have been a bit unstable, making this urge to cut a slit in my arm a lot more difficult to handle.   i've also had a bunch of dreams of killing myself in a manic rage as a way to prove a point, and i'm getting concerned that in these dreams i cannot stop myself from going through with it.   i've never cut myself before, never self harmed in any way but food restriction and sleep deprivation before, and i sleep and eat on a strict schedule now to prevent that, but it feels like the mania is taking over and i can't stop myself from worrying what i might do. i don't think i will hurt myself, but the thought is just so loud in my head and the spot my brain has decided i need tho cut into feels itchy and taut, as if it wants me to cut it open for some release,  even though i know this isn't true.  i just needed to vent and write this out, my partner gets so worried whenever i mention that my brain is being mean and i don't want to worry him. he knows this is going on and checks on me and helps me in the ways he can, but it's difficult for either of us to do anything about it...",0,0

"i'm too tired to even react to the thoughts. anyone else have these? i cried afterwards and felt uneasy anyways, but it wasn't like i used to feel. i used to feel so much panic i couldn't eat or sleep. now, after dealing with horrific thoughts for three months straight, day after day, all day, i've gotten tired.   i had intnede sexual  thoughts, the really horrid types i won't even type out, and while i still get them and it frustrates me, the intense anxiety and everything is mostly gone after working with a therapist.  a few days ago literally out of nowhere i started getting horrid violent thoughts. luckily not frequently, but they disturb me so much. literally started out of nowhere. i just remember getting a sudden faint image of a man and just knowing he was being hurt. like o heard inside my head shouts. the image, thank goodness, was barely there so i didn't actually visualise it but it was the sound my mind created.  then later i suddenly got an image of my family. it's disturbing and i try not to think about it but the images resurface every now and then and it freaks me out, i feel super uncomfortable and uneasy. it's not nice, getting an image of your families heads just rolling off or something. or an image of someone hurting them with a chainsaw or something. it freaked me out because 1. i hate violence and i hate horror and anything like that 2. it's just terrifying, i don't even know where the truck my mind came up with that from, i don't watch those kinds of things and i never had any violent thougths at all.   now i know it might be ocd (i was told i most likely have ocd by a doctor and therapist) but it's torture. these thoughts are horrific and scary. every time i get them i want to escape from my own body because it's horrible. i shake my head, squeeze my eyes and try to redirect my thoughts because i don't want them to possibly 'play out' more or morph into something worse, and i don't want to focus on them because they're awful and make me feel sick.  i cried already and i couldn't focus for a while. anyone else here have nasty thoughts like this??",0,0

"schizophrenic  thoughts, after a dissociative episode in august 2021 i had an interesting, and frankly terrifying episode. i had consumed so much caffeine and weed (thankfully i kicked both of those addictions by now) that i seemed to have broken my sense of reality. nothing around me seemed real, not even myself. i could barely feel anything, not pain nor my emotions (besides anxiety which didnt even feel all that bad given the situation). all of my senses just seemed distant from me or very fleeting. i didnt feel in control of my thoughts or actions, and for half of the three day episode i just kept repeating my name over and over in my head while i watched my life like a movie. in the midst of it i mis-assumed it as a psychotic episode as i wasnt totally sure if anything that i was seeing was real or just a hallucination (thankfully i did not hallucinate nor have i ever had hallucinations). my anxious mind immediately thought of the worst case scenario, that i would become a paranoid schizophrenic. after the episode i had a two day period of extremely elavated mood and then the anxiety returned and so did the thoughts about schizophrenia. its still happening even now, dozens or a hundred times a day. most the time just the word, as if im calling myself schizophrenic for things that arent even related to the disease (like if i see something odd out of the corner of my eye, i know its normal to not totally process that stuff and its not a hallucination, but the thought still happens), other times its complete thoughts. its extremely interrupting to my normal thoughts, and i cant seem to get away from it even if i ignore the thoughts as best as i can",0,0

"confused over a situation involving a fight with a bully of mine during middle school many years ago i would like to note this happened a long time ago back in middle school. its just something that has been gnawing at me for years. in fact, its one of the two big moments which i still think about.  i wouldn‚Äôt really call him ‚Äúevil‚Äù, cause i don‚Äôt know what demons he might have been fighting, but a guy, which we will call sam, bullied me for years on and off from 3rd grade to 8th. note that i said on and off, since the harassment wasn't always constant. hell, during most of middle school he was actually friendly, and being native, i beleived he had really changed. when has haressing me, he would call me names, whip me with his gym pants, and do things that the school deemed ‚Äúnot a problem‚Äù. eventually i got so bad that i got into a fight with him in the latter half of middleschool. he didn‚Äôt even fight back really. my memory of the fight is a bit hazy. he was my height and a bit chubbier than me, but still. the fight is a bit of the blur, i just remember pulling on his shirt and hitting him, but not with full strength. he bent over and i pulled his shirt off and after that, someone who worked at the school saw what was going on (we were fighting beside the track and field with a parking lot right next to it, in front of the school. she saw it pretty well). what‚Äôs funny is that was the third instance of that happening that period. people broke up 2 other ‚Äúfights‚Äù we had earlier that period. wasn't anything big, just me pushing him a bit everytime he tried his shit. for someone of his caliber, i expected him to be smarter. this was 8th grade btw. i just saw him pissed, almost crying during the last fight, and after it. to this day i don‚Äôt exactly know what to think of it. he still bullied me after, and my parents made it very clear to not fight back since i would get in trouble with the school again. as a good kid i just accepted it, and suffered in silence for a while. i still think about him at times. sometimes i think of day dreams where i beat him, kick him, and just turn his face into a messed, bloodied version. visons of slamming the back of his head on concreate, stomping his head on the ground, gut punching, with full force this time. in a sense, it makes me feel good, poweful, but also sick, since that isn't me, and could get me in legal trouble. other times i wished i had tried to reason with him and turned the other cheak sort to speak ""jesus style"" (i think that kind of sound stupid but i kinda find it funny, if a bit sad) . i just ignored him. or rather tried to ignore him. i suspected over the years that he might have been abused, since my dad remembers his mom having a limp, but that was years ago. i don't know, i like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but i also hate doing so, since i tend to let people get away with bullshit. overall, i don‚Äôt know if this story fits this sub. also my grammar is awful, might change shit in the morning.  tl:dr a bully of mine i had a fight with had me thinking and making me feel sick for years and i came here to share.",0,0

"anyone else feel like they are being led down a path toward becoming a worse person, due to ocd? i feel now more than ever that i‚Äôm being led down a path toward self- destruction and that i‚Äôm slowly morphing into a person i don‚Äôt want to be because of my pure o thoughts revolving around self hate, violence and hopelessness.   i don‚Äôt think i really deserve good things anymore and i don‚Äôt know how to deal with that, because how the hell should i live life if i believe i should constantly punish myself?  i keep trying to do better, think better, but i‚Äôm so miserable and i dislike myself more than ever, because three years ago, at least my scary, awful  thoughts caused me to panic, show emotion and fear.  but now, except for a crying episode once every month or two, i‚Äôm just completely numb to everything.  i worry that since i can‚Äôt stop my constant decline in personality, one day i‚Äôm really going to snap and seriously self harm myself out of desperation.  i‚Äôm becoming a worse and worse person with every new year and it‚Äôs terrifying me.  recently i started using a dating app although i‚Äôve never dated before. someone matched with me and i thought we might meet up, but now i don‚Äôt even think i want to. i worry that what i‚Äôll act like isn‚Äôt me and i‚Äôll just be faking who i am. this person also seems like a sweet person, and i don‚Äôt like the idea of me being as mentally confused as i am, meeting with her. i think i‚Äôm too early to try to date and maybe the whole relationship idea just isn‚Äôt something i‚Äôm cut out to do.   i‚Äôve had  thought ocd for 8 years now and it feels like i‚Äôm slowly suffocating with every passing year until all i become is a shell of who i once was.   i feel so ashamed.",0,0
"does anyone else's brain do this?

"will exposure therapy work for these thoughts recently i've been having this fear of becoming a nihilist. i would get  thoughts telling me ""nothing you do in life matters"". i'd be just going about my day and thoughts would pop up telling me ""none of this will matter in 15,000 years"". for some reason, my brain cares a lot about if i'll be remembered forever when i die & if what i'm going to do with my life will matter for years to come, and if doesn't then it fears that i'll be depressed forever.  for the last few weeks, my obsessions have gone from the meaning of life to solipsism, to life after death, death anxiety, and now whether my life matters or not or fear of becoming a nihilist then getting depressed.  my brain tells me that if i don't figure out a solution to the nihilistic thoughts that they will make me depressed for the rest of my life and i'll never be able to enjoy anything. it tells me that my old self is gone and can never come back.  i'm basically just asking if erp works for these thoughts. my brain is telling me ""no"" because on a forum i was told that ""nihilism is inescapable and that once you realize that nothing matters, you're doomed and you will never be happy again"" this just inflates fear.  if you read this and are familiar with ocd treatment, can erp help these thoughts or am i doomed to be depressed forever cause of this?",0,0

irrational fear of developing gangrene if you don't know what it is... well you can google image that shit but fair warning it's pretty nsfl. apparently harvey weinstein had gangrene in his peen and was deformed so he got off on manipulation by making his victoms feel bad and humiliation. gangrene is very rare but i can't imagine what that shit would be like and i can't stop thinking about what would happen if i were to develop it.,0,0
"is this normal or is it wrong? when i masturbate i think of anything. like daydreaming but uncontrolled. it doesn't arouse me at all so i don't use these things to excite myself at all but i feel a bit guilty sometimes, because i can't control these thoughts, , when they appear and it makes it seem like i masturbated or climaxed to them.  usually i think of a music video i watched, i replay conversations i had, i think about future plans, or even about going shopping with my family, minecraft, what i have to do, lessons from school, anything.  it's not related at all to being aroused or anything, but i feel a bit guilty because sometimes i imagine, i don't know, talking with a family member or just a picture of someone like my grandma or dad, i remember things like that and it makes me feel guilty? does it mean i masturbated to those things and to my family and to other things, or not? it doesn't arouse me at all it's just a sort of daydream that i can't control. i never imagine sexual things so i don't know if this is just messed up or if it's all okay.",0,0
"my ‚Äúcursed‚Äù knife gives me the call of the void my father gave me my first pocket knife when i was 12. ever since, every time i look at the knife i get the strong urge to cut my arms so that i bleed to death, and i can clearly picture the carnage. i locked it away when i was 14 and thought i lost it. since then i‚Äôve owned other pocket knives and carried them around since they‚Äôre handy in a pinch, and never had the urge. same goes for regular knives and sharp objects. cleaned out my childhood bedroom last week, found the knife, and as a mentally stable 22 year old adult with a lot of future plans, got the same urges again. dropped the knife like it burned me and slammed the drawer shut. can‚Äôt look at that specific knife without having urges. brain immediately started chanting ‚Äúcursed knife cursed knife cursed knife‚Äù so now i‚Äôm calling it the cursed knife. idk whatever fuckery is going on with  thoughts surrounding that knife specifically but i‚Äôm not touching it.",0,0

i have  thoughts telling me i did something really fucked up that i know i didn‚Äôt do they torture me and drive me insane constantly. i‚Äôve always had  thoughts but nothing ever this extreme. at first i‚Äôd just brush it off like i did with all the other  thoughts i have. but then one day a few months ago i started arguing with it and i haven‚Äôt stopped since. it puts me in a constant state of fear and paranoia making my heart constantly beat very fast and my chest feel very tense and uncomfortable. my brain focuses on these thoughts so much that i‚Äôm always fighting to keep myself in reality. i feel a constant urge to not leave the thoughts alone even though i know there‚Äôs absolutely no reason i should believe any of it. it baffles me at how much i fear that i did something i know i couldn‚Äôt have possibly done for absolutely no reason at all besides this demonic voice in my head that just tells me i did it. it embarrassed me how much this holds me back in life i have many other real issues that i could be stressing over but instead i chose to go in circles everyday over something that shouldn‚Äôt ever cross my mind. i feel helpless and desperate for something to stop it but i have no one to talk about it with as i feel doing so would make me feel so awkward and embarrassed. i have with my therapist before but it seems to just make it worse tryin to ignore it seems to be the best thing i can do. i‚Äôm at a point where i‚Äôm too weak to get on with my life and i‚Äôm scared these thoughts might destroy my hopes and dreams because i dwell on them too much to focus on my own reality. i‚Äôm completely lost on what to do i‚Äôve almost given up. has anyone heard of anything like what i‚Äôm experiencing? i feel so alone like no one else goes thru what i‚Äôm experiencing and i‚Äôd feel better if i wasn‚Äôt the only one,0,0

"thoughts about family members getting hurt hi, i'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this but please hear me out.  i've been having thoughts of my family members (my mom, dad, and sister) getting hurt in car accidents or in typical scenarios at their place of work. i'm not sure how to describe it but it's like this fear in the back of my mind and sometimes for this reason i just can't handle news on the tv about road accidents and such and would cry almost everytine these sorts of accidents happen then pray for the victims.  i'm 17 but i've had this sort of anxiety since i was around 7, i think. my parents normally arrive home at around a specific time and i remember calling them before work to ask when they were coming home and around what time they'll arrive then checking again if they were home late. my grandparents would joke about it but it was pretty serious for me. i remember when they had dinner parties or late meetings and i couldn't get a hold of them on the phone i would call them 10+ times until i could reach them or until my other family members put a stop to it.  my mom's office is near our house and school and i thought it'd be better as i was closer to her (5 minutes away from home) but sometimes i hear the ambulance and will panic until i call her and she picks up. i really struggle with it and it consumes my mind half the time. i opened up to my parents about it and they said whatever happens, i'm going to have to accept it and left it at that.   my parents recently took me to a psychiatrist and i was prescribed some antidepressants for unrelated reasons (not turning in work for the subject i'm good at > my teacher saying i'm a perfectionist > the teacher talking to my counselor and the counselor telling my parents i should get help) but when i brought this up with the psychiatrist she just dismissed it. we've only had a few sessions so far and i think she thinks i'm just a normal teenager anxious about schoolwork and graduating high school as she ignores this whole issue altogether despite me bringing it up all four times we met (she diagnosed me with anxiety and avoidant personality disorder). i would really appreciate it if any of you guys know how i should approach this topic or if anyone had experienced this or have any resources i could look into or any advice in overcoming this.   fyi: i live in asia and i think mental health is still a bit stigmatized here and anyone i ask in real life would probably tell me to focus on schoolwork instead of ""daydreaming"" about these scenarios.  i'd sincerely appreciate it if anyone can offer me advice or guide me to any online forum because it's been getting worse and i hope i can get it together soon because it interferes with my parent's time and is a huge inconvenience to everyone around me.",0,0

"i can't stop thinking of this specific immoral sexual thought i hope this is the right sub. i didn't know where else to post.   a week ago i (16m) was watching a video about some old video game... idk, i wasn't paying much attention to it since i just put it on as background noise to clean my room to. then, the narrator of the video mentioned that in the game, a body had been dismembered. for some reason, that phrase was all it took to start a weeks worth of thoughts that are honestly horrible, immoral, and against my religion. i was thinking ""what would it be like to cut off someone's limbs like that? they'd be helpless.""   and now i just can't force the image out of my mind of me cutting off the arms and legs of a girl and uh, doing bad things to her. i just recently got back my sex drive after months of it being completely dead from sadness, and now the only thing i can get off to is this specific thought... it upsets me because i know its wrong. in the moment, sure, it seems hot, but then after i finish im left there thinking, holy shit, i said i wouldnt do this again, i said i was done with immoral thoughts... and i did it again.   i know god is probably sad that i do this, think about this. jesus literally commanded men to rip out their eyes if they have lustful thoughts over seeing a woman... if i dont stop this soon, i'll be in a world of pain in the afterlife. after i'm done with my lust and its been satisfied, i think of how this displeases yahweh elohim and cry.   i hate lust. back when i was too sad to get it up, i said i wanted it back, but now? i hate it so much and i wish i could just never get horny. over anything. it impairs the ability to think... to see right and wrong. you think of doing things that would send you straight to hell. you think of killing people, torturing them, shooting them, but in real life, you'd never do that. free from the influence of my dick, i know right from wrong.  literally what the fuck am i supposed to do? i cant push the images from my mind. i can't. i enjoy it in the moment, but afterwards the guilt is immense.  any tips? my friend told me to visualize jesus dying for me on the cross, but it hasn't helped much. maybe i'm not visualizing hard enough? all i want is to be rid of this thought. i wish i never conjured it up in my mind.",0,0

"does this count as acting on  thoughts? or not and i'm just overthinking? so i've sadly developed severe sexual themes ocd a week ago. i feel so sick. it centered around my parents mostly and i feel disgusting. i had other themes but this one is by far the worst.  long story short, it started with an  image of doing something sexual with my dad, i freaked out and prayed it wouldn't affect my mum. sadly it did.  so it went away, and if i and left it i'm sure it would've gone away. but stupid me has to always make it all worse. normal people would've let it pass but for me it was the end of the world.  i was terrified that when i got one of my beloved mum, that i might've had a groinal response (a normal reaction but i didn't realise it). i would've left it. i should've. but i felt so terrified, that i kept bringing the images back into my head and focus on my down area to see if anything happened. it's sick and disgusting. but i was scared. how could i even be having these images?   i was constantly 'aroused' when i woke up, probably by anxiety, because it felt uncomfortable, but i was so stupid. i was scared it was because of the thoughts so i thought i was living a nightmare. i didn't think that it was something i had everyday, i woke up like that a lot even without any thoughts. why didn't i leave it?? i kept getting the image thoughts, and one time when i was in bed i got them, and i moved to the side wanting to go to sleep after ruminating the whole day, and i had a horrible sensation.   i was petrified. was that a sexual repsonse? a groinal? an orgasm? i didn't know since i've never experienced anything sexual. what the hell was it? i didn't know. it was really strong, like a clench but it wasn't pleasant at all. it was strong but not a nice feeling. and i was terrified because i thought, was it because of the thoughts i just had?? or just because i had anxiety arousal and when i moved it caused it? what the hell?  so i did something stupid. i was so panicked, since i didn't know if the clench sensation was sexual (never felt it before) and i couldn't just go to sleep with the uncertainty of what it was. i should've been logical, it didn't feel nice, so it wasn't sexual. but i was half asleep, panicking and didn't make that connection. i thought, the only way to find out what a sexual sensation was, was by masturbation, because masturbation brings those things about, and then i'd be able to be at peace if i knew what to actually look out for. then i'd be at peace and know it wasn't the same as the sensation i was getting from the thoughts. i thought it would be problem solved. so i did it (also i remembered it brings anxiety relief so i decided to do it for that too). then i felt horrible because, isn't this acting on thoughts??  does this count as acting on the thoughts? did i just commit incest? people tell me no i didn't, but i feel disgusting. i feel sick and vile. while i didn't do it to the thoughts themselves, because that wasn't my intention at all, i would never do that because it's disgusting, i did it in relation to the whole situation in a way so doesn't that count?  like the whole thing? does this count as acting on the thoughts? i obviously wasn't thinking them (they popped in twice or so but i i immediately stopped because it would be disgusting to carry on to them, i could never consciously do that) but it was kind of related to the whole situation? i can't face my parents. i feel so awful. i feel like i ruined my beautiful relationship with them. i love them most and i feel like a monster. i did not think it through, it was the middle of the night, and i thought it would bring a solution, because i was scared, but i can't stop feeling like it means i acted on those nasty thoughts. i wish i could turn back time and not have this happen. now i have to live forever knowing i did this.",0,0

""all your attraction to her is not caused by your family, you only like her bcz of your insestious thoughts. you're attracted to your family, you're into incest.""  it'd been 5 days of trying to shake this off i can't it's not stopping  what do i do  i'm scared i've completely ruined my emotions towards her bcz of this ""bond"" i've created by going through with the thoughts. help please i can't take it. i dont feel like i can ever see her the same way again. i can't live like this  anymore. pls someone help, and not by giving me false or untrue hope. did i break my brain into merging my gf and familymember now? i hate this i hate it.  and you're gonna tell me, ""since you hate it, you clearly didnt"" but what if i did, and im in constant denial, and im too scared to try and think it through because i'm scared its true. idk what to do pls help",0,0

" thoughts during anything sexual (nsfw) tw csa i cant carry this shit with me into next year its messing with me to much  so, i'm only a kid but i've started to have really  thoughts doing anything sexual or thinking about anything sexual.   i think the reason for this is because of my mum. i hate blaming shit on people but in this instance i'd say i'm very justified. after years of hating myself and being unstable and suicidal i decided to question whether all of it was really me and after seeing 3 therapists i've realised my mum is abusive, perhaps not intentionally but she is.   and unfortunately part of it is the fact that she has no boundaries. while this sort of behaviour has stopped from 7-13 she has given me complete grief  she acted in a very sexual way and i'd argue sexually abused me to an extent or just very much overlapped her boundaries    while shes dome plenty of other things i think these things amounts of  thoughts on the daily but especially if i think or do anything sexual   it's like all those things she used to say to me echo through my head constantly and it never stops. it like echoes and sounds all distance like it's a character in a film   i know everyone is gonna tll me to go get therapy but i literally cany because i know if i told them all that shit about my mum they would 100% have to report it because i'm still technically a minor. i dont think my mums intention was that bad. yes she did it on purpose but i dont think shes a pedo, but more just an extreme lack of boundaries.   it's just i cany deal with these constant disgusting thoughts anymore i've dealt with ocd all my life but without any compulsions just constant  thoughts   idk anymore",0,0
"i feel so sick, i hate  thoughts this is disgusting to type, i feel like a monster even though everyone tells me i'm not one. but here it goes.  i developed horrible sexual  thoughts this past week (been told i have ocd so it's a bit relieving but i still feel gross). it started with  images of sexual acts with my dad and my mum, and while i could've dealt with that, i did something horrible.  so i kept imagining the images to check i didn't get the groinal response, and i did, and i still could've dealt with that. it's horrible, i can't believe i imagined those things on purpose, it's hard to deal with, but, i was terrified if i was actually aroused. i was so scared that what i felt was a sexual feeling i panicked. for some reason my mind said, if you felt anything down there it means you're aroused by the thoughts. so i kept checking myself every time the thoughts happened.  it's disgusting. the thoughts were there so often, and when i was in bed, i obviously had the 'groinal', i had it non stop to be honest, probably because of the intense anxiety, and when i moved to the side to go to sleep, i got a horrible sensation 'down there'. i panicked, thinking, was that a sexual thing? did i get that to the thoughts? this happened right before one thought appeared in my mind so i panicked. i didn't want to have any feeling down there to these thoughts, however i didn't know what 'sexual things' feel like so,  i decided to touch myself to find out what feeling aroused/sexual feelings actually feels like. because i didn't know what it felt like. i've never actually been aroused that i know of. so i did that. so i would know, and would be able to tell afterwards.  does this mean i touched myself to those thoughts? i feel so disgusting, i keep telling myself no i didn't, because your intention wasn't to do that to those thoughts, it was to find out if what sexual things feel like so you will know, but i'm going crazy. but i did it to compare, which is technically doing that because of the thoughts right? i feel like an actual monster. who in their right mind does this? i don't know anymore.  does this mean i touched myself to those horrible thoughts?? please please help, i am in a very desperate state. i can't deal with it. later, when i did just touch myself just for anxiety relief, the thoughts did appear and i immediately stopped when they did, but continued after i redirected my thoughts, does that mean i touched myself to them too?  i can't believe i ruined my life like this. if only i didn't get the stupid idea to check, i would've been fine. do these things happen to anyone else?",0,0

"// please help, i feel really disgusted abt myself because of my  sexual fantasies whenever i masturbate i get  thoughts about really gross and taboo sexual stuff that disgusts me, but for some reason my body reacts to these with pleasure. i think its because the idea that it's considered wrong or taboo is arousing to me, not the specific fantasy my brain throws at me. i've finished to them multiple times and i always feel so much shame and disgust afterwards, thinking about these things doesn't even get me excited, i just react like anyone would; ""that's gross, i want to stop thinking about that."" it's only when they pop in mid-masturbation that any pleasure comes out of it. and at this point anything considered ""normal"" can't get me off the same, and i'm so conflicted and worried that i'm a horrible person. i'd never do the things in these fantasies in real life, the thought isn't appealing whatsoever. it's not even something i obsess over or anything, its just fantasies that pop in my head mid-masturbation and then leave immediately after, just leaving me feeling guilty and disgusting. am i a bad person? ive read a lot and ik normally people would say ""no, you're not,"" but considering i've actually finished to such fantasies makes me feel so fucking awful. i have so much anxiety over it its suffocating.  im diagnosed with high anxiety disorder, adhd, and depression, but not ocd, so that just makes me feel worse, like i dont have an excuse or explanation for this. i feel like i'm just genuinely a monster.",0,0

"religious experience when i was 17 trigger warning  at some point around that time i was in a really bad state. i was experimenting with thoughts that i shouldn't. about two years later i began to have my first visions. they included the end of the universe, of me being designed once again, using my thoughts as a ""reason"", and advanced technology resistant to heatdeath, to rebuild me from nothing and place me in a pocket universe where i would be tortured eternally. i escape only to be tracked for infinity, flying through a really small donut-shaped universe in a ship that can just barely outrun the figure who tortures me. i don't know who that figure is, but i believe they went to high school with me.  fastforward, i asked lucifer for infinite knowledge because i wanted to become immortal and all powerful. went really badly. my brain couldn't contain the information so i became overloaded and started to decay alive. i died, being a walking corpse, bones and shit were just decaying as i was animtaed but not living.  i asked god for help (i was an atheist). it worked (i am not proletyzing anyone here, you have your own beliefs if you want). i now feel obligated and connected to god because he is the reason i was able to survive this encounter, whether he is fictive or perhaps something that exists. i owe him, in my mind or outside of it. in return, i follow the bible loosely and consider myself a christian but with great limitations because i believe the fallability of the bible as it has been translated too many times.  ultimately, i got on medication but no matter what these  thoughts continue. now, my dreams are predicting future encounters with perfect accuracy. it is a family trait. it is amplified in my mental state, because i can be influenced by people who were like me in the past. i am not a genius but the opposite, i cannot systemize, i can produce something from nothing, abstraction rather than organization. so in a sense, what is seen as ""madness"" is really the fundamental process to everything humanity sees in the world.  i'm pretty fucked up but i know it. i just don't know the solution, i can't ""see"" what's happening i can only sense it. i have so many  thoughts, they're out of my control. i just know to stay in one spot, if i leave i will end up on another continent, lacking in funds and probably with nothing but the clothes on my back as everything will be stolen. i am not innovative, i am not adaptable. it just results in a failure for me.",0,0

"need advice with  thoughts hi everyone. hope you are safe and alright.  long story short. i've been cheated on in my last relationship (ended about 5 years ago) and it completely crushed my selfsteem and gave me loads of insecurities.   it was hard, but thanks to therapy and support i got over it and i started to meet new people. i'm currently in a new relationship (1,5 year) and she is amazing with me. we talked about our past, and we have experienced to be cheated on in our last relationship, so we understand each other very well.  this is the issue. a few months ago, i asked her about a guy she never told me about but i saw in her phone when notifications pop up a few times. she told me that he was a guy who was flirting with her, but she was giving him the runaround for him to stop. i didn't feel comfortable with that and i asked her to stop talking to him. she did, but she got angry with me for thinking she was flirting with someone. the truth is that she was not telling him to stop, until i told her. after some days, she told me that it was an awful way to making someone stop flirting and she was sorry about that.  the case is, the situation gave me ""vietnam flashbacks"". i started to feeling kinda insecure and started to have selfsteem problems again. i told her this, she told me she didn't understand why i was feeling like that, but she was going to be with me.   this last month was great in terms of the relationship, but i'm still struggling with some  thoughts of she cheating on me, like my last relationship. f.e, she went out with a friend a few hours ago and i was kinda nervous. i'm not a controlling or toxic guy, i don't expect her to stop going out at night, to stop talking to her male friends or to know what is she doing 24/7; absolutely not.  i totally trust her and want to be with her, but i'm just losing the battle about managing this thoughts again. i try what i learnt in therapy, but it is not working. any advice i get here would be great.   thank you.",0,0

"do these count as  thoughts or am i just discovering that i'm an evil person and i'm in denial because i can't accept the fact i'm messed up? (serious) i honestly feel so terrified, yesterday in the most random moment i thought, what if i'm a psychopath/sociopath. (my  thought obsessions have been sexual in nature for a long time.) then i found out what sadism is, i didn't know before, and now i'm panicking, what if i'm a sadist. what if i am one?? i can't live with the possibility, i'd rather kill myself. i always get new obsessions/ or they just morph into worse ones, when i feel happy. i had just gotten out of a 2 month 'episode' of intense distress and anxiety because of them, and bam. this happens. it was so random too, i've never even considered the possibility of it.  i get thoughts as images so it's even more disturbing because it feels like i imagine them on purpose ( i don't even know anymore, i just know i want them gone and i cry a lot because of this problem i have with disgusting obsessive thoughts ).   after freaking out about what if i'm a sadist, i even imagined it on purpose to 'check' myself and it felt like i do enjoy them, but i can't tell the difference between excitement and anxiety because it feels the same (like a pressure/weight in the chest and heart beat gets stronger) and it's making me feel insane, how do i know??   i don't want to enjoy disturbing thoughts like these, i don't want to be messed up. does this mean i have no empathy??? then that would also make me a sociopath right??? i can't be them i just can't but what if i'm in denial?? what if i'm lying to everyone because i can't accept that i am this person? am i really overthinking this or am i just messed in the head? my parents say i'm, if anything, overly empathetic but i find it hard to believe because of these new obsessions. i don't know i'm so lost, any help would be appreciated.",0,0

"i literally have no clue what to do! i get this panic attack all over my body, like i'm experiencing nausea and a fever, because i'm so disturbed and heartbroken. it's the christmas season, yet i feel that i literally can't tell anyone i know what i'm experiencing day-to-day because they are just as powerless to my  thoughts as i am!  i tried medication, i tried therapy with several different theorists back in the day and it just didn't help long term. this year has been awful for me looking back on it. my childhood piano teacher, a dear friend i've know since i was 10, passed away in the spring. a childhood acquaintance i had growing up was randomly murdered earlier this year too and a friend of mine (roughly same age as me (m25) )  lost his father recently this winter, who passed away not long after thanksgiving.   earlier tonight i just decided to dive into some of the horrible people and horrible things that my ocd keeps pestering my mind with (serial killers, genocide, murder) which seem to ask me every day in my mind ""oh don't you think this is fascinating?"" or ""you don't have any emotional sympathy to these things- you're apathetic to all of it.""  no matter how many times i tell this stuff to shut up, and try and spend my time thinking about other things, i just can't beat it. i always have been a very empathetic, sensitive person, so these constant accusations of my character in my mind along with the mental prodding for me to ""check out"" the evils of horrible people and ""how they got away with it"" just has gotten to me. i sometimes will get in such a panic attack like earlier tonight that the only thing i can think about is the dream i have to end it all.   there's so much that's wrong with me (depression, hopelessness, self hate, confusion) that i really dream everyday and certainly in episodes like tonight of just killing myself. i don't even believe anymore that i'm a good person! i won't kill myself because i don't want to put that on my family, but by god, if it wasn't for them, i'd do it in a heartbeat.   i'm so lost for words. my childhood acquaintance who was murdered earlier this year- there are youtube videos about his death uploaded by his county's news channel and shockingly there are such nasty comments of disrespect and jeering toward him, a victim of murder, that i just wanted to smash my computer into a million pieces out of rage and helplessness. he was a farmer for christ's sake. someone who lived a quiet life. we both had that in common- that was our childhoods growing up on farms.   i just don't have an outlet to cry out to (outside of this reddit community i guess) because my mother will cry if i reach out to her with this stuff and my father will go into a tailspin of worrying about me and trying to get me a therapists where i live if i tell him (i happen to live 9 hours away from them in a different state.)   i just don't think there's any point in trying to unload any of my pain/troubles on anyone around me anymore because i see how futile it is. by the way, i am not on any medication at this time. i haven't taken meds prescribed by therapists in years, since discussing it with my last one and weaning myself off of them. i just didn't see them having an effect on me.",0,0

"i feel like my thoughts aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbad‚Äù enough i get  thoughts and compulsions. i haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with anything yet because my psychologist doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs more like ocd or generalized anxiety. all i know is that what i‚Äôm experiencing is  thoughts.  i get thoughts like that talking to men or male presenting people means i wanna have sex with them, or that i‚Äôm in love with them. sometimes i imagine sex with them/get mental images and i don‚Äôt like it.   it‚Äôs not all the time tho, and it doesn‚Äôt last for hours on end or anything and i don‚Äôt act out compulsions for hours either. i also get checking thoughts. especially when i‚Äôm out of the house. i went to the beach with my boyfriend the other day and had to keep checking things were in my bag. i had to do it myself and i did ask him if he could check for me at one point cuz he was holding my bag but that wasn‚Äôt enough and i had to do it myself. i have to take it out my bag and put it back in, i can‚Äôt just see it in there and be fine. but it‚Äôs not crazy it‚Äôs just i feel anxious and i need to check so i check.  being nurodiverse is genetic in my family(been confirmed by doctors that it is genetic) and almost everyone on my mums side has something like adhd or asd. but i worry that it‚Äôs just anxiety cuz i get anxious over other things too and i always have ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù in my head.  but i feel like because it‚Äôs not serious nothing is wrong with me and it‚Äôs all in my head and i‚Äôm faking everything. which is another  thought i regularly get, that i‚Äôm faking everything.   and my compulsions aren‚Äôt usually that bad. with the faking one i get really distressed and when people ask if i‚Äôm ok i kinda convince myself i‚Äôm ok and i just repeat over and over again ‚Äúi‚Äôm ok‚Äù and if people keep asking i get angry and can shout that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me and it‚Äôs all in my head. with the sexual and romantic thought i can move away from people and not talk to them or i can‚Äôt ask teachers for help or to go to the bathroom cuz of the thoughts. with checking the compulsions are pretty obvious, i check. often it‚Äôs worse on public transport tho as i‚Äôll check multiple times and still feel anxious after leaving the transport and have to check over and over again when i get off.   i just feel like i‚Äôm not valid i guess or like i‚Äôm faking it idk. i just needed to get it off my chest",0,0

"i almost eliminated my parents one night when i was about 14 or 15, my dad got furious because one of my friends had come up to my window during the day to talk to me through the storm screen that was in front of the window (i would just slide my window up and talk through the mesh screen). there was already a huge hole in my screen, i‚Äôm guessing from the weather over the years or just normal tear since moving in the house about 10 years prior. but the window itself was intact and fully operable. well, he claimed my friend made the hole larger than it was although i knew nothing had changed about the hole. he came into my room yelling and grabbing me by my shirt, shaking me. then he slapped me. unfortunately i was standing between my closet door and a wooden dresser and when he slapped me, all i remember is knocking my head on the dresser then waking up on the floor to him screaming at ‚Äúmy dumb ass‚Äù to stand up. i‚Äôm not sure how long i was out for but i feel like once i opened my eyes, it took at least 5 seconds for me to even understand where i was, and at least another 5 seconds to comprehend what my dad was saying.   that night i just laid in my bed kind of numb. not crying or anything, not upset because it didn‚Äôt phase me anymore, just numb. at the time before i knew what i know now, i figured going to jail wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. i spent 2 days thinking of this detailed plan (that i realize now was stupid) all to take a knife from the kitchen and be able to hide it in my room without my dad or stepmom noticing, i managed to pack some clothes and a phone i‚Äôd been hiding and put it away in the back of my closet. i can‚Äôt remember where i was planning to run to now that i think about it but i had the major part down.  that second night, i had gotten the knife into my room and managed to stay awake until my dad went to bed. i knew to wait at least 2 hours after they had fallen asleep to try anything so once they went to bed, i sat by my door and just counted down. after the 2 hour mark hit, i stood up with the knife in my hand and my heart just started pounding. i slowly turned my doorknob and walked out my room as if i were walking to the bathroom. i figured if they were still awake, they would question if i‚Äôd walked straight to their door. so i walked across the hall to the bathroom and listened for my dad snoring, movements of the sheets, stuff like that. i ‚Äúused the bathroom‚Äù and waited for the toilet to stop flushing so i could put my ear up to the wall to hear if they were still snoring. they were.   i walked out the bathroom and crawled into their bedroom to my dad‚Äôs side of the bed, since their backs were both facing that way. if they woke up, i could easily duck down and crawl out. i stood up over my dad with the knife behind me, thought about exactly what i would do and then i just froze. i don‚Äôt know why but i just couldn‚Äôt get my brain to tell my hands to do it. it‚Äôs crazy trying to explain it but it‚Äôs like my mind wanted to do it but my hands wouldn‚Äôt move. i snuck out the room and went to the kitchen, put the knife back and went to bed. the next day i erased it out of my mind and every once in a while i still think about it. then i put it back into the pit of my mind again. my dad doesn‚Äôt know and we have a very shitty relationship to this day due to his abuse and narcissistic personality. i love him because he‚Äôs my dad but he cannot be apart of my life. he and my stepmom divorced and i haven‚Äôt seen her in years.   i have told my brother about this incident and he said that he almost did the same exact thing to my stepmom, then he stopped himself and just went back to bed.",0,0
"accidentally watched some gore and  thoughts are strong rn i accidentally watched a bit of a gore video and it made me feel physically sick and i wanted to cry, after some time i started feeling less nauseous about it but then the thoughts about it came, basically things like ""what actually happened in the video"" ""was what i saw really what i saw"", which are know are probably thoughts that are going to haunt me for a bit unless i watch the video again but i don't want to, even just going on the page with the video hidden made my stomach hurt. but not only those thoughts, also a lot of thoughts now about my pets and my family and my friends dying in brutal gory ways, gory pictures in my head and things that make me sick. when they appear in my head, i feel sick again and they make me cry, i try to avoid them because i can't stand the visual but it's hard. i feel bad, scared and paranoid after watching or reading a lot about crime, and gore. i also have thoughts like ""if you don't do this specific thing, then (my pet or family or friends) will die in a brutal gory way"" or also  thoughts about things happening to me. my brain will tell me things like not to spell a word a certain way or to do a specific little thing so my family do not die in the most gory way ever, even typing those words make me uncomfortable, it's almost four am and i'm really scared to sleep because if i close my eyes i know the gory thoughts will come back. i know it'll eventually calm down and get better but in the meantime i feel scared and i still feel sick. sorry if the text is a mess, i just. would appreciate if anybody have got any advice in this situation. thank you if anybody read so far",0,0

"anxiety on november 29, the fire alarm in my building went off. my building has tons of code violations and most people didn‚Äôt even know if the alarms worked since there were signs warning residents about it. in my entire 33 years of life thus far, i‚Äôve only experienced fire drills, burnt popcorn and run of the mill false alarms. i wasn‚Äôt worried at all and just chilled in my room thinking it was accidentally triggered by someone working on the building. the alarms kept going blaring and i saw fire trucks outside which heightened my anxiety slightly. i still  thought they were probably just there to disable the alarm. i decided to check the front door of my condo and immediately smelled a super strong smell. it reeked of burning plastic. i am not positive but thought i could also psychically see smoke. that‚Äôs when i panicked. i hurried to close my bedroom door so i could contain the cats since they were relaxing in there. i immediately grabbed a carrier from my front hall closet. i felt like i didn‚Äôt have time to fuss with two separate ones. i was literally shaking trying to put them in the carrier but they didn‚Äôt seem to fight me. they usually whine and cry but they were silent for some reason. i grabbed them, my keys and my phone and went downstairs. people weren‚Äôt concerned in the slightest. i got the gossip that the 4th floor apartment had an insulation fire. i was the one weirdo holding a twenty pound carrier of cats while others stood by visibly annoyed at the inconvenience. a lady in the building was very interested in my cats and said she had two as well. she said if things got bad she would go and grab them since she lived on the first floor. i felt silly but i was fearful that if the fire got out of control, i wouldn‚Äôt able to grab them and that regret would haunt me. the fire was put out and had no effect on my floor. the smell however, gave me migraines for hours. i thought this was the end of this traumatic event (traumatic to me) but over the next days to weeks. i started having instructive thoughts that gave me panic attacks and left me in extreme distress. i googled (i know, not the best thing to do)and found out that all my symptoms were in line with something called ‚Äúharm ocd‚Äù i was confused but i did have ocd behaviors as a kid that i didn‚Äôt realize was ocd until i was older. when i was younger my parents told me it was silly that i would have do touch things to feel safe. i agreed with that and it seemed to disappear until 20+ years later. do you think the potential fire was the cause of this resurgence? i was also getting off different meds since my primary care would no longer keep prescribing gabapentin and zanaflex i‚Äôm curious to figure out why i went through a mental breakdown so suddenly. i have this fear i‚Äôll blackout and kill my cats in my sleep. i love my cats and they mean the world to me.   i‚Äôm not looking for ‚Äúreassurance‚Äù cause from what i researched i know that is a bandaid for the problem rather than a solution. i‚Äôm just curious about why it came on so suddenly and i‚Äôd love to hear other people‚Äôs stories.  i‚Äôm talking to my therapist tomorrow. she knows about my panic i had already and we decided to have a session about it. i‚Äôm already diagnosed with anxiety, depression and add.  any thoughts would be appreciated.",0,0

"what if you did something incredibely embarassing or sad or terrible right now? *content warning for absolutely everything, i guess. i am so, so sorry for writing this out. i dont recommend anybody reading this, at all, but i must write it out in painful detail. i must get it off my chest.*  **what if you did something incredibely embarassing or sad or terrible right now?**  like, something so embarassing it would be straight up sad. imagine in full detail how embarassing it would be to live with the consequences. something so embarassing that people don't just forget, but they get second hand embarassement so strong it grows on them, as if merely witnessing the event had the effect of participating in it. what if you did things like that constantly?   how about this, maybe not something so embarassing, but just sad? what if each time your parents asked you to come with them to visit your family member's grave you said ""no"", because you prioritized watching youtube videos instead? not with malitious intent, but because you were incapable of realizing the weight of a death in the family, and you were so oblivious, immature and pure, that you simply couldn't comprehend such matters. what if you were obese and unhealthy? what if you only drank soda and ate way too much sweet food. you pretty much did that when you were really young, which is understandable, but what if you never stopped? what if your parents kept buying it, knowing full well how unhealthy it is. imagine how unhappy they would be with their life, as their son keeps getting unhealthier, is chronically online and their lives slowly pass monotonously by.  what if you jumped out of the window? its half a meter away from you to your left, and you are 6 stories up. you are one handle-bar twist and jump away from doing it. imagine if you just left no message, last words, reason, nothing. imagine if you completely ruined the lives of your family right now for absolutely no reason, as you fall to your death. what would be going through your mind? why would you do it in the first place? imagine your aspirations, goals, achievements, relationships, bonds, ideas, hobbies, music tastes, future plans, things you are excited about, things that bring you happiness and comfort, headcanons, stories, everything, plummet onto the pavement for absolutely no reason. imagine that whole immaturity scenario again. what if you were really young and didn't understand what you were doing, and were to regret it extremely badly once you were actually falling to your death? what if you were that kid, watching some minecraft videos on your greasy old lenovo, eating lays chips, and you fell out of your window? imagine screaming in agony as your young undeveloped mind refuses to accept your fate, and your entire body is filled with adrenaline as you fall for those excruciating couple of seconds, impacting the ground and diving head-first into an eternity  of nothingness. imagine your father coming home at 5 pm, only to find out that his son jumped out of the window, with the reason seemingly only beeing sheer mindless carelessness.  what if you were a single father, whose child had major depressive disorder from birth that was permanent? imagine being a father with a 4 year old that is physically incapable of feeling happiness, going through the desaturated colorless fog of life, whilst you were completely oblivious to his condition. what if you were a father that would be the total opposite? you would be a quiet optimistic person going through a below-average boring suburban life, only living with your son, and you would try to cheer up your son on a daily basis, being only met with a sympathetic poker face and a sigh. you might think to yourself that your son is simply a bit on the down-low, whatever it is its natural. as children often feel immortal through naive inexperience, you feel as though your son is perfect and that nothing is wrong with him anyways. imagine one day coming home, maybe a couple days away from his 6th birthday, or maybe, a couple days away from christmas, and smelling a terrible odour from somewhere in the house. imagine following the smell, only to find your son had hanged himself. how would you feel, as you quickly  the knot and brought the cold pale corpse on the ground, only to find no pulse? cpr is unsuccessful and the paramedics pronounce him dead on the scene. on a scale of 0 to 10, how would you rank the utter hopeless terror and sheer indescribable agony youd feel in that moment? that moment that dragged on forever, that moment that engulfed you, folded your stomach into a knot, made your heart burst, chewed you with its terrible teeth and spat you out in your own vomit and tears. how would you describe your life leading away from that moment?

"what if i sexually harassed her? my pure-'o' is causing me to feel suicidal. hi, all.  i'm a 23 year-old man with asperger's syndrome, who's worrying about the following  pure-'o' thought:  in july 2020, i was on tumblr and happened to come across a young woman's blog, where some men had asked sexual questions; she responded directly and (as i remember) in a way that showed comfortableness - not unhappiness or anything negative.  thinking it would be okay to ask a question, i then proceeded to ask a (very tame) one, before falling asleep. i'm certain that had she said anything negative, i would not have said anything, out of fear of crossing a stated boundary.  after waking up excitedly and finding out that my 'ask' had not been answered, i moved on with my day, etc. now, unsurprisingly, i'm doubting whether or not she was comfortable with the other men, and whether or not i sexually harassed her.  specifically, the doubt has me worrying over this simple interaction even more so due to having asperger's syndrome, and so the ocd will make me think, ''well, maybe you misunderstood her potentially sarcastic reply?!'', and i feebly retort, ''well, ya' got me there, buddy!''.  ''what if she only responded in a non-uncomfortable way because she felt socially-conditioned to do so as a woman?!'', is what my brain has thrown at me, and it's ridiculously frustrating.  through my 'self-therapy' sessions, i've remembered how i'd originally reflected on this a few months later and thought, ''she was okay with it'', and given that the memory was still at the time quite fresh, i didn't doubt my reflection, and that was the end of it.  that said, the worry isn't leaving, now - what do i do?",0,0
"all limbs being . i'm 20f and i've had  thoughts for as long as i can remember.   well, a huge fear of mine, and a reoccurring  thought of mine is losing all of my limbs. i know this is a reality for some people, but regardless of that, it's something that popped into my head as a child. ""what if that happened to me?"" i don't know in what scenario that would happen, but i was terrified of it. when i got a little older i ran across a youtuber who had gotten bacterial meningitis and had to have her limbs amputated.   after viewing her content, and although she was extremely inspiring and funny, i became so worried about getting this that i rarely wanted to leave my home anymore and i had to stop viewing her content, which i typically enjoyed because of her humor, but the  thoughts would ruin it for me. it didn't make sense and i knew that.   well, today, as i was scrolling through tiktok, someone posted a clip of a movie or a show where a woman had her limbs amputated unwillingly. it didn't show gore or anything, it was the aftermath. there were in a house with another woman, so it's safe to assume she was being held there against her will. and she woke up in a wheelchair with no arms and legs.   it made my skin crawl, it made me feel nauseous, and it's all i've been able to think about today. i've tried watching other videos, youtube, movies, grocery shopping, cooking, washing my hair, cleaning my house. it keeps just... rerunning in my head. i can't stop thinking about it. and when the woman screamed, obviously it was a movie, but it was a blood curdling scream. the helplessness that person had to have felt if that ever has happened shakes me to my core.   i just can't stop thinking about it. it makes me feel like there's something wrong with me and it's going to happen to me eventually.",0,0
