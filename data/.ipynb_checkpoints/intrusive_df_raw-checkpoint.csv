They're not something you can control, they're unwanted etc.

So my question is do ANY thoughts make you a bad person? Regardless of whether they're intrusive or not? 

Like let's say there's two people. They both commit the same actions. Neither of them hurt anybody. However person 1 always has horrible, disgusting thoughts, questions in their mind etc. Are they both an equal amount of a good person? 

I'm starting to worry because my intrusive thoughts have started to not feel intrusive anymore. Like I remember when I first started having them I would visibly recoil, sometimes even gag out of disgust, or feel like wanting to cry. But now I've become so used to them that it's like they have no effect on me.

 I don't feel a strong emotional reaction towards disgusting thoughts, and I feel like this makes me a bad person. It makes the thoughts feel like not even as bad as they would have originally sounded which I know is awful. I feel terrible. I feel like I'm deceiving my loved ones.

I have struggled with intrusive thoughts for YEARS, and this only the latest one. I have also seriously weighed this issue, and have ultimately decided that I enjoy being a man, and I have no desire to be or become trans. There is no evidence of past behavior that would suggest it, and when I really think about it, I would hate to be trans. Due to the nature of how being trans is treated on the internet, it seems like ANY indication, thought, or action, no matter how trivial, can be evidence that one is trans and they just ""haven't realized it yet."" The nature of that argument alone makes these thoughts terrible to fight off, as denying them or reaffirming my gender just strengthens them. There is no recourse. 

The origin of these thoughts can be traced back to a singular moment, earlier this year, where I was playing a song I wrote for a friend. The friend pointed out my use of the pronoun ""her"" and insinuated that it sounds like something a trans person still in the closet would right. The song was written about a person I knew in real life, let's call her Louise, a singer-songwriter who would spend her days busking on street corners. However, even though I initially brushed off the comment, it began to eat at me in the back of my mind. Was this the echoing of my subconscious, did I truly intend that interpretation without even realizing? After giving it some thought, I decided I didn't, and it was a simple oversight on my part on how the song could be interpreted. But the thoughts continued, and began to scare me. I started responding to them (horrible mistake), which only made them more frequent.

It has been 3-5 months now, and I still struggle with this every day. I can't reason it away, I can't let them pass without responding to it because I'm terrified to, I HAVE to respond. Sometimes the back and forth gets so bad I have to audibly shout ""NO IM NOT"" to get them to stop. I was looking into trying meditation, but it says that you're supposed to ""observe thoughts without emotion, and let them drift away."" I fear that if I do this the thoughts will consume me and I'll ultimately decide that I am, even thought I KNOW that I'm not. So I'm stuck. It's DEBILITATING. WHAT DO I DO? Should I let the thoughts wash over me in mediation? That sounds terrifying....

I'll preface this by saying I'm demi-sexual, part of the asexual community, meaning I'm incapable of feeling sexual attraction to men I'm not on a deeply connected with on emotional and spiritual levels. That said, I'm not overweight but gained more weight in the past year than I'm comfortable with. It's half my own fault as I eat healthy almost as often as I don't, and the other half is medical treatments for my symptomatic anemia and menorrhagia that cause weight gain.

Ahem. Anyway .\_.

Let me be blunt that I don't want a boyfriend, partner or whatever. I find myself being most motivated when I'm around people or things that inspire me in the moment to do better and be better. In this case, having a friend who is also like a personal trainer who is just unfairly beautiful to look at and a decent conversationalist I can talk nerd culture stuff with. Someone who can help light that fire under me I need to keep me from slacking and losing motivation to exercise.

My diet isn't terrible but there's room for improvement, so that's an easy change. But he could help me look up some different recipes to try. Now, I have absolutely zero interest in a romantic relationship of any sort. I want an attractive fit guy to help motivate me to get fit because I want that drive that years of bullying and abuse make it difficult to maintain. If you've ever played any of the first Mortal Kombat games with the Test Your Might segment, maintaining self-motivation is like mashing the shiatsu out of the AB buttons until I feel like I can break my bad habit like that block of ice from MK1.

I heard how it's best to surround yourself with people you want to be like, and that's where I'm at. I'm told I'm attractive here and there, but it's hard for me to believe that as I spent too much of my life not seeing myself as anything more. Now, I believe you can appreciate a work of art with no desire to take it home with you. Humans, like anything else in life, can be considered works of art depending on their appearance (dark skin with light eyes, sharp features, etc.) being especially unique from most others.

Growing up, I was the bookworm who doodled in her notebook, not went out to play softball or basketball with the other kids. So naturally I've never been very physically fit. It's what they call ""skinny-fat"" despite me not being skinny. Curvy-petite yes, but not skinny. Pear-shaped, I'm told. But yeah, I'm not getting any younger... or slimmer... So, having a physically attractive guy help me sculpt myself into a healthier version of myself is what I want.

Does that make me vain? Probably.

I want to cry so much. I was in an app looking for some clothes and I saw a video of a girl with this kind of top that is open in the middle, so you can see the center of her upper body and a bit of her chest.

Then I have this thought: ""Isn't that too much?"" I think first, then ""isn't she provoking, isn't she a sl*t?""

My reaction? Getting angry at myself and saying ""How can you say that, you b/tc-"" and then I slap myself kinda hard in the cheek.

I felt horrible for that thought, for not respecting her body and her decisions. ""Why do I have to think that about this girl? If she's not doing anything fucking wrong, is she hurting anyone? No. Then why doesn't anyone have to criticize her or call her a ""sl-t"" for wearing whatever she likes, huh?!""

And I feel terrible both for ""thinking"" that (in quotes cause I don't know if it's me or my intrusive thoughts anymore) about that poor girl and for the slap. In the end that's self-h/rm and I feel like I've normalised it a lot, because I think I'm a monster, because I think I deserve it. Because I think I'm never going to change cause I ""don't want to"" and that I deserve to be punished for so...

I'm trying not to find reassurance, but to get any advice on self-love and self-confidence. I feel there's some part of me that truly didn't understand the concept of wearing x clothes maybe due to internalised misogyny, but I also feel like whenever I want to admit it or any sort of mistake, my brain just goes ""no, you HAD to respect that person from the very beginning, you're a monster. Now suffer"". Basically it's a mixed of OCD and pure perfectionism (you have to know everything, otherwise it means you were having ""typical bad person thoughts"" in first place). It's like... I can't stand thinking something wrong (unfair) about anybody or anything, even if it wasn't my choice to have that idea since I probably indirectly learnt it...

I cry just the thought of something happening to them.  Which is where my OCD attacks all the time.  Many themes of OCD over the years.  It‚Äôs a living hell.  I manage for the most part.  But my mind always goes back to past events and says what if.  Latest one was what if I drank and fell asleep at the wheel.  Killed someone and got a DUI manslaughter.  Being in prison and having my wife and son come visit very little.   Will they wait for me.  These kind of thoughts constantly run man.  I don‚Äôt even drink.  Been sober 10 years now.  But my mind creates these scenarios and I constantly ruminate on them.  It breaks my heart because it makes me feel like I put our lives at risk.  I have had intrusive thoughts my entire life.  When my son was born four years ago is when I was told about intrusive thoughts.  I did feel better but they attack once in a while from time to time.  I keep telling myself everything is fine.  I‚Äôm not in prison.  Things are going well actually.  OCD and anxiety just keeps going.   Does anyone else change events and create consequences from those events.  I‚Äôd love to hear about your story and how you deal with them.

The list of intrusive thoughts consists of:

*threatening to taking away my ability to sleep or feel sleepy.

*threatening to take away my positive memories or memories that were at lest peaceful.

*threatening to control how my digestive system works.

I always felt disgusted by the temptation of my brain for its unruly and sexual desires. And as I have regained control of my thoughts I will flick my head as if I was flicking the person to whom when I was unethical.

When stress mounts, the intrusive thoughts will come and comfort me. Sometimes even speaking toward me, trying to reason with and also convinces me of following their path to a fulfilling life. There are two as I have known, one who is moral while the other who is aggressive. The moral person will try to speak to me about the path of morality and ethic. To abide by rules which will break my stubbornness in accommodating societal standards. Although many times I tried heeding her advice, it never work because of the incompatibility of personality. The aggressive person will try to convince me to be more aggressive and dominant, although he has a lustful streak. Likewise, I try going along with him but that doesn't work out.

I will at times have conversations with them as if they were real people. So much so that optimism comes when both of them try to cheer me up when I am down, as if reviving me from my downfall. Sometimes I even feel that they are true companions or the fact that I am trying to falsely believe that they will only be the one that truly understands me. I couldn't trust others with my true feelings, after all, I have them. However, they may argue with each other and also agree, but that does not mean that I will agree with any of them. 

I've asked others about my situation, which I recently just found out and realise what my intrusive thoughts were doing. None, or only one, could relate to what I am experiencing.

I've been trying to find out where this comes from. Why I am having these intrusive thoughts. With my bad memory, I think I have found one of my earliest memory where it might have come from. 

TW after this, I think.

So I shall begin that this is my fault. I was a gaming addict. I didn't care about my studies and would lie my way out just to play some more games. However, when I was 13, there was a month when I am in a constant bad relationship with my parents. Stress mounts for my need to play games while my parents disagree about it.

One day my parents asked me to go study and not play games. Of course, I abide deceivingly by locking the door and placing a textbook on my lap while playing my game. After some time I hear knockings on the door. I quickly place the phone away and open the door. My father was suspicious and quickly asked for my phone. He hold on to it and knew right away that I was playing games because it was hot. Then, he was screaming in anger, scolding me harshly. Let me remind you that the stress between my parents and me had been piling up for weeks, it's a no-brainer they will respond as such. However, suddenly, I felt scared of what my father might do due to his erratic body language. I took that as an aggressive stance. I was like a dog back in the corner with his tail between his legs. The moment my father approached me with that aggressive stomp, my brain was ringing with alarm that this was a huge life-threatening threat. 

The moment he grabbed my hand I felt like I just lost control of my body. As if the instincts have taken control like I was just an observer of my own body. The religious would say a demon has possessed me. I punched my dad in the face a few times, knowing clearly that I intend to shut down the threat. However, it all felt peaceful, as in quiet. The short moment felt long yet tranquil. I'm not sure if I'm there, but I felt like I was another person. Until I suddenly realised what I was doing and gained control, with someone else screaming within me. I felt like there were three people within me, one who was aggressive and the one who screams, my moral counterpart. I was left in disbelief that I did it, even today. I never felt I was in control and out of the characteristics of my behaviour. Afterwards, I was always left with the belief it wasn't me that did it, it was somebody else. But clearly, I am trying to avoid the blame and I couldn't accept it. However, the feeling that I felt was so real, that I couldn't deny it. So I am left with this ambiguous feeling. 

These intrusive thoughts could just very well be the scars from the past or due to hiding my true persona with masks upon masks. I will never know. But I will continue unravelling myself to understand my thoughts better.",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,90738,public,self,Curse and a companion?

But now I've been having intrusive mental images pop up while engaging in self pleasure. Really disgusting things that I don't want to think about like family members, young people, etc.   


The first time it happened it happened right at climax, a mental image of it popped up. I immediately stopped. Because I stopped the orgasm was completely ruined. But I felt satisfied and reaffirmed afterward. ""I'm not a bad person, I sacrificed my pleasure just so I wouldnt accidentally have a mental image like that while climaxing""   


But it kept happening and I started getting frustrated with the ruined orgasms. So I tried to come up with a way to make it stop. I remember back a year ago when it first started happening I would just continue while the mental image was happening during climax. After a while, it genuinely worked and stopped happening.   


So I tried that last night, I ignored the mental images and climaxed. But I just felt so guilty and disgusted afterward. I feel so sick and I don't know what to do.   


I was never getting off to the images, I was just imagining scenerios with my boyfriend. All I wanted was some self pleasure after being stressed for so long. And now I feel utterly horrible.

Firstly, I want to say my ‚Äúdeath wish‚Äù thoughts. Every time I‚Äôm having a good time or watch scary things that have to do with death or other morbid things, my mind will ALWAYS be like ‚ÄúI hope [blank] happens to [person]‚Äù or somebody in trouble/in the hospital/ life or death situation. Heck, it might not even be people in trouble, literally ANYONE. The same thoughts reply just praying to lord something bad will happen to some random strangers on the street and it just pisses me off. My mind won‚Äôt only wish death upon others, but me too! Every time I walk on the street, my mind says: ‚ÄúI wish [blank] will happen to you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI hope [random stranger] will [blank] you‚Äù. The worst part is, I fear that god will actually listen and make it happen, and I try with my LIFE to suppress them so god doesn‚Äôt listen.

If you know what I mean by ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù then you already know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ This one is REALLY awkward, it just. Ew‚Ä¶ you can see where this is going. It just ‚Ä¶ com- NOPE!!! Just. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT!!!!

I have religious intrusive thoughts as well but it BARELY happens

Now‚Ä¶ you guys must be wondering: Well what the heck must these thoughts started from. These thoughts could actually go from 2018 - 2019 actually. But those thoughts weren‚Äôt as intense as they are now. I also had intrusive thoughts about one of my fav YouTubers in 2020. But it went away months later. Where it ACTUALLY started getting bad was in late 2021, but it all started  in April 2021.. I loved this mod called ‚ÄúDave and Bambi‚Äù but it atrociously took a mad turn after my mind said the characters are ‚Äúgod‚Äú and such. When they‚Äôre not, well, Bambi is, but in the game (it‚Äôs canon) but nobody will legitimately believe he‚Äôs god‚Ä¶ right? Well‚Ä¶. My mind did, but not me. It also told me a bunch of //other// people are god but like‚Ä¶ why? It also told me to ‚ÄúConvert to another religon‚Äù or such. Very annoying as you can see.

There‚Äôs people on this sub saying that disabled people are more likely to get these thoughts than anyone else. Which I think I am since my mum‚Äôs new iep copy for me in the future said I was diagnosed with adhd multiple times. I also had found an autism diagnosis from district something (I don‚Äôt think I should say..). It‚Äôs from seven years ago (2015) but I‚Äôm not sure cos they‚Äôre going to give me evaluation for it in months. But since I have a lot of evaluations coming and the autism one is last. Expect no update for a while. I have a fear of lying to you guys just in case I‚Äôm not mentally handicapped but I just want to mention this extra information.

Just a side note that if you‚Äôre suffering from these thoughts a lot here are some tips:

If your thoughts aren‚Äôt praying to god you should just ignore it. I know it‚Äôs a hard pill to swallow but ignoring these thoughts can make a difference. You already know these thoughts aren‚Äôt okay and you could never support them or listen to them. So just ignore them, take a sip of coffee or tea (if you don‚Äôt like coffee) or water if you don‚Äôt like neither. And no, you aren‚Äôt acceptable of these thoughts in any way if you just let them in there. They‚Äôll go away the more you ignore it. Watch your favorite show or hang out with your friends! It‚Äôll go away.

I'm new to this sub and I suffer from what I believe is intrusive thoughts. They negatively impact my waking life and my dream life. 

What are my intrusive thoughts like?
I have many types that go though my mind. When I'm around knives , I think to myself , what if I just picked this up and stabbed whoever was around me?

When I'm in public settings surrounded by people of different races than me , I often think to myself what if I yelled out a racial slur? I'm not racist at all though. 

When my kids were little I would have thoughts about hurting them , not that I ever would and I never did. I love my kids with everything in me. 

When I'm on quiet places , I legit get the urge to scream at the top of my lungs. 

Last night in a dream or what some would call an Astral projection experience, I called a celebrity a racial slur in my mind and he heard me , I felt terrible!

I also have intrusive thoughts and in my mind I come up with really morbid , evil jokes that are related to situations I either read about , am going through or things that other people are going through. Even though some people with dark sense of humor would find them funny if I shared them, I never find them funny and I hate when I come up with them.

I've only shared my problem about having intrusive thoughts with two people in my life , but never went into detail about any of them. 

It sometimes feels like I have touretts, but in my mind and luckily not vocal. 

How do you deal with your intrusive thoughts? Do they have medication for intrusive thoughts? Is having intrusive thoughts related to any type of mental illness or is it considered a mental illness alone? Is it recognized in the mental health world?

I want to start off by saying if this is the wrong place to post about this I‚Äôll take it down immediately. I‚Äôm quite ashamed about how this happened but I will be describing my expierences in full detail. 

Yesterday I was browsing an audio porn website and came across a post that was just tagged with ""beast"". I didn‚Äôt fully understand. Curiosity got the best of me and I clicked on it. I had never heard of beastiality like this before. or thought about it for that matter. I was quite confused. They just dropped their desire to do that so plainly, along with a bunch of other things. I didn‚Äôt understand how someone could be so blunt about that. I ended up listening to another post of his about that. I could hardly understand what he meant in the other, so I thought this would help. I was genuinely very shocked. I ended up looking up things like ""why is beastiality real?"", ""is beastiality legal?"", and anything related really. I ended up coming across posts of people describing their experiences, desires, and hatred for these acts. It seems to be completely illegal. I‚Äôll revisit this later. I tried to move on. I was still struggling with these thoughts. I ended up listening to another audio about this. At this point, I'm not sure why I did that. I don't know if I was trying to understand, look for a rational solution to this or if I was aroused. I‚Äôm very ashamed to type that out. I didn‚Äôt end up finishing it and just cried and thought about this more for a bit. Fast forward to later, I go on an app to talk with people. To my surprise, someone had a lewd joke about their dog in their bio. I wanted to confront them about it, only to realize I had forgotten how to spell beastiality. I ended up looking the word up to confirm and going back to the app to talk. Later, when I opened the Google app, I see I had accidently clicked on a porn website for this. I immediately clicked off once it hit me what I was looking at. I was shocked and disgusted. I promised myself I wouldn't seek out any of this real content. Even if it wasn't intentional, I still feel like a depraved person for seeing that. When I did hit the back button to get off that website, I saw it was the first thing to come up under the definition. I'm so upset by this. When I was researching this earlier, it seemed to be illegal in my area. Why is this so accessible when most places in the United States prohibit beastiality? I looked for some people speaking of similar experiences, but I haven‚Äôt really found anything. I‚Äôm not sure if this even counts as intrusive thoughts. I feel like a sick person. I decided to sleep on it. Now here I am skipping class to write this out. I can't get these images or thoughts out of my head, and they're distressing me. It was hard enough for me to accept that having intrusive thoughts didn't make me a bad person. This is new to me since I feel I have put these thoughts into action.

Presenting you religious protractor- The religion plane (like an argand plane) is a graph whose x-axis represents atheism and the y-axis represents the religiousness of the person.

For those who don't know what argand plane is, here's the Wikipedia definition.

**Argand Plane** \- the complex plane is the plane formed by the complex numbers, with a Cartesian coordinate system such that the x-axis, called the real axis, is formed by the real numbers, and the y-axis, called the imaginary axis, is formed by the imaginary numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why did I choose the Argand plane?**

Because I believe, you all can disagree with me, that religion is a social construct and it is somewhat imaginary. The only reason that religion is not considered delusional is becasue it‚Äôs common among the people.

Anywhooo getting back to the graph.

**Max scale** 100 - maximum extent for being religious / non-religious

So if I say I'm 50+20r (r is the iota of this plane). I'm 50% atheist and 20% religious and I think this is the better way to express yourself because there's more information on each component.

The problem with this graph is that some point doesn't exist like 100+100r, the person can't be extremely religious and also an extreme atheist at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now what the 4 quadrant represents

**1st Quadrant:**  (X+Yr)

Any points except 100+100r exist.

**2nd Quadrant:** (-X+Yr)

In this quadrant, the person can be religious but hates atheism because it is on the left side of the y-axis.

**3rd Quadrant:**  (-X-Yr)

This is the only quadrant that I'm not sure of what it represents because both the parameters are negative. The problem is when the person is not religious it automatically means he/she is an atheist, this statement creates a problem because according to the quadrant the person is not religious and not an atheist too which is absurd.

so what does a person follows if he/she is not religious and atheist at the same time?

After thinking about it for a few minutes,  I came up with another theory that this type of person follows some weird ""cult"" or a ""person"" or a ""group"" or does an activity. They don't give two shits about religion or atheism.

**4th Quadrant:**  (X-Yr)

In this quadrant, the person can be an atheist but hates religion because it is on the negative side of the y-axis.


Next time when someone asks whether you believe in religion or not, just tell them your coordinates :)

I had an overnight trip to an observatory a month ago and the teacher gave a presentation about space (all the planets, ozones etc.) It was actually pretty fun to learn.
However towards the end, I had found out for the first time that in 5 million (or billion? I don't really remember) the sun will explode and all life on earth would be gone. 

It didn't really bother me until after I came back home that I've started worrying about it. It started when I try to go to sleep.

I know that it'll happen long after I'm dead but for some reason, I keep thinking that I may come back alive in another body and experience it for real. Ridiculous I know but its a thought that keeps bugging me when I try to go about my day.

Surprisingly, I'm actually suprised that I'm more scared of dying by the sun exploding than being scared of death itself. 

I know it sounds weird but if I do die and if we do get reincarnated into another body,  I would like to at least come back to life AFTER the sun exploded (yeah I know its highly unlikely but hey there might be other planets with life out there. :p) or at reincarnated in a time Way more earlier than now.

I honestly thought maybe I just had a pee, poop, vomit fetish but the more I think about it, these thoughts aren‚Äôt usually sexual I just kind sexualize it sometimes as a defense mechanism but it‚Äôs not exactly the most pleasant thing to think of during sex/jerking... I wouldn‚Äôt call it a fear or a phobia but more like an intense cocktail of emotions... like a train-wreck and I can‚Äôt look away and it‚Äôs kind of distressing...


My boss told me a story about his son my age peeing the bed at a sleepover all over some carpet and other kids and he described it as ‚Äúit was bad‚Äù and I keep thinking of it when I look at his son for some reason. It‚Äôs like a flashback and I see his face and I see a deep sense of shame and helplessness. It‚Äôs just a silly childhood story but I wonder if that‚Äôs like a core memory for him. The emotion of his dad sounding embarrassed and sympathetic as he told the story, and this guys generally sensitive nature just made the story kind of hit me in a weirdly personal way and I feel a maybe inappropriate protective urge over him, as well as a mild underlying sense of ‚Äúgeez I‚Äôm stuck working with the bedwetter‚Äù which I feel guilty af for thinking. 


Similar thing an ex told me a story where he was playing basketball at church in like 5th grade and was planning on waiting til after the game to go poop but it ended up all coming out and dropping onto the floor and his shoes in front of everyone... he had a lasting anxiety from that and would basically nearly or slightly pee or poop himself sometimes simply from a fear of that exact thing happening. He‚Äôd later go on to recklessly make a lot of mistakes with driving, drugs etc (hit a person and dog while driving, puked all over my friend‚Äôs couch and carpet, and not a lot of show a lot of remorse (more like look how drunk I got haha) I think deflecting some of that energy maybe...


Stories about bedwetting, barfing, public pee and poop accidents just give me such a weird train-wreck out-of-body experience. I want to sympathize with and love the person, but I also get like suspicious like they did it on purpose or out of laziness or voyerism...  


Idk it seems like there are a lot of emotions around pee and poop and then as a corollary, shame, trust, independence, forgiveness, empathy, vulnerability, safety as a kid. Somewhere in there it connects with some emotional experiences I must have had. I see myself in their shoes and feel shame, and also loved by whoever forgives me and afraid of whoever doesn‚Äôt or whoever just judges. So many complex emotions to deal with for something so juvenile and simple as poopoo peepee and vomit. 


I waste hours looking at r/incontinence and r/adultbedwetting because the stories are like emotional self torture of peering into other people‚Äôs emotional burdens. Seeing people lose that sense of control, and end up in situations where they feel a bit disgusting, but then overcoming it and carrying with them a humiliating secret... and it reminds me that anyone around me could be secretly in a diaper and uncontrollably peeing themselves as they talk to me. 


I also have a weird thing where I can‚Äôt cry and it feels akin to peeing myself, to being unable to control liquids coming out of me ig. Also a common thing to do when one pees poos or vomits on themselves...

I worried that... if I describe any of the thoughts I had during an episode (with the details intact) it would be crossing a line, and people would be scared of me. Visually that would be hilarious because I'm barely 5ft tall- but still. 

I'm really not a violent person. I'm hesitant to retaliate even when I'm actually being harassed because I'm afraid that if I snap I'll actually hurt someone.

&gt;Happiness blooms in the presence of self-respect,and the absence of ego -¬†‚ÄãJonathan Lockwood Huie

Sometimes it‚Äôs better to move on than to hold on to a person who doesn‚Äôt understand you because it will take so much out of you to try and get them to.  


You have to let them go so you can move on with yourself and life.  


This doesn't mean you must become a selfish person.  


It only means that you can no longer give them any of your attention when they don't want to give the same attention back towards you.  


You must give to receive but if you are not receiving in return, you have to become absent towards them.  


It's the only way that we can [hang in there](https://www.quasiquotes.com/hang-in-there.html) and be free the way we must during our short time we have in life.  


Your absence could end up teaching them a lesson of what your presence towards them should have meant while you were giving it to them.  


It is definitely hard to grow self-respect for yourself which brings you to a happiness level if you haven't yet already in your life.  


Your ego begins to become absent because you no longer need anyone else's presence in order to be happy within you.  


‚ÄãRemember to treat your absence as a gift to others when they don't appreciate your presence because they need to try and understand if they are in fact doing something they shouldn't by keeping you away.  


In reality you are gifting them with your absence...

They further believed that this was inevitable, unless their Geoengineering project was utilized, and that only through accepting despair and love could we achieve spiritual death/rebirth.

Though I left them after I realized how toxic and hostile they were, I still see them semi-regularly on YouTube and it always upsets me. I also cannot get their beliefs out of my mind, especially when I feel the compulsion to constantly check up on them and their sphere of influence.

I am constantly in fight or flight mode, constantly expecting the apocalypse and Human extinction. I additionally have OCD, ADHD and Autism, so these have become obsessions and ruminating thoughts for me.

I know that it doesn't help anything. I know that, even if they were correct, worrying will only ruin my life. But I can't seem to stop.

I can't even enjoy reading or writing much anymore, since I can't picture a world where everything isn't mundanely catastrophic- for want of a better word.

I know that separating myself from discussions around climate change and the environment would probably help, but I'm not willing to do that- not completely at least. It is something that I am passionate about and I feel like I need to do all I can to help create solutions and systemic change- even If I can only play a small part.

Is anyone else going through something similar?

1) i woke up today from a dream i was having, in short i walked out of the store and i was stabbed in the side and forced to walk with the dude who stabbed me with the knife in me, next thing i know some guy is trying help me and the stabber is using me as a shield so in the middle of them fighting my whole arm is getting sliced up and have many cuts, i assume this is an intrusive dream bc it's triggering for me cause i used to &gt;! self harm!&lt; and the dream is about me being injured, is this really an intrusive dream?? 

2) About a few weeks ago i woke up in a panic from what i thought was an intrusive dream, at the end of the dream there was someone i saw jumping off a building then inside tht building talking to i assume the police about what happened, these forensic guys bring a suit case in as I'm walking out and open it and there's a body inside, body that looks like it was in acid and in the dream I was scared to not actually see inside but i already knew in my head and hid in my dream and woke up uneasy and in a panic, is this a form of intrusive dream or just an nightmare?? 

The first dream i had was a sexually intrusive So i already know with this one. 

Someone please let me know!  
I know dreams mean nothing and intrusive thoughts mean nothing to my character but i wanna know what these kinda dreams are

In the beginning, my obsession revolves around  illnesses, particularly covid. Now, it‚Äôs been sexual intrusive thoughts involving strangers, people I know, and even family. I still have the health obsession but not to such a high degree. Recently, I have an obsession with contamination. The fact that my therapist and I weren‚Äôt able to communicate properly. 

I don‚Äôt think I can distinguish a compulsive need to be certain vs genuine pleasure anymore. The focus of my sexual intrusive thoughts have always disgusted me but a year later I don‚Äôt if I‚Äôve accepted them or if I‚Äôve been lying about having ocd and I‚Äôve liked them. My sexual intrusive thoughts ran rampant, but know I can‚Äôt tell which thoughts are intrusive and which are truly mine. Only during sex is when I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm experience rampant intrusive thoughts. I just wish I had the answer or better yet I wish I was back to who I was before this started. I keep telling myself I‚Äôm one thing but with all the thoughts and compulsions I‚Äôve done; I can‚Äôt say it without it feeling like a lie. As of now, it feels like I‚Äôm liking the thoughts when I never would‚Äôve considered it a year ago.

My contamination aspect started around the covid obsession. I remember washing my hands until my skin cracked. I was never fully convinced that I was safe from covid. Then, when I thought that I was exposed to a carcinogen and spreading it to others,  I washed my hands before touching items, scrubbed down items to get the carcinogen off, bought new clothes in case the carcinogen was still there, and cried whenever someone touched an item that I touched. At this point, the only only thing keeping me sane is that I have no evidence of spreading carcinogens. If I really did come into a contact with a carcinogen, then it leads to a morality crisis. 

Finally, my heath obsession sprung from the covid 19 pandemic. I was afraid of catching or spreading covid, so I didn‚Äôt go out outside of necessity. I would always be terrified of the ideas of covid, so I would frequently leave class to get tested, and would stay away from people.

However I am diagnosed with a whole fuckload of menta disorders. One being OCD, so this happens even when I'm not high as well. I was also in a kind of daydream state during this as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was about to go to bed and as soon as I was about to switch off the light I had a feeling like this creature from The Witcher ([https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-bruxas-powers-in-the-witcher-season-2-explained/a-vampire-with-a-beautiful-face-1639852293.jpg](https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-bruxas-powers-in-the-witcher-season-2-explained/a-vampire-with-a-beautiful-face-1639852293.jpg)) was going to come out from the opposite corner from my room and just jumpscare at me yelling ""I won't ever let you sleep... I won't ever let you sleep"" and then I'll just die of shock or some shit or the creature will kill me...

Then, the next part, which was the weirdest shit I've ever had an intrusive thought of, I needed to go to bed ASAP and under my blanket for protection against the whole room turning into a red-toned disco room from hell? I know this shit sounds so weird but anyways this intro of this song playing in the background for the room ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6xt6Qksklk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6xt6Qksklk))...

Also Imagine something like this ([https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fb/e9/57/fbe957112180dfe73e7f0a56c93d9d91.gif](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fb/e9/57/fbe957112180dfe73e7f0a56c93d9d91.gif)) spinning in the ground, but red. Then there are also these red rocks and red sand (or netherrack from minecraft) in the corners of the room, it was like my room teleported into a red, rocky cave room from hell. I was scared as shit and 100% convinced this was going to happen.

So for about a month I have been dealing with major sinus issues where basically fluid is trapped in my ear and not draining. I have a referral for an ENT from my doctor and am waiting on an appointment to be scheduled. 

Ever since I got sick, my mental health has completely changed out of nowhere. I started having panic attacks, I‚Äôve had about 3 or 4 in this last month. I also have had a lot of days of feeling weird and what I say could be dissociation and lightheaded.

 I also started now having a nonstop thought about what if I wanted to commit suicide or what if I go crazy enough in my mind to. I‚Äôve never been depressed or suicidal, and I‚Äôm not sure if this is all just linked to being sick. I‚Äôve always had some anxiety, but rarely ever have had panic attacks either. 

I am very bad about self diagnosing and looking at the depression and suicidal subreddits nonstop, and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm now in that bracket even though I have way too much to lose. I‚Äôm young, make good money, have a wife and great family, and want to live until I‚Äôm old. So why am I having this random thought about suicide that doesn‚Äôt seem to go away? Do I just try and accept it for what it is? Is it just a intrusive thought? I‚Äôm struggling to know if I‚Äôm actually becoming a suicidal person or not. I‚Äôm not sure how to get rid of these thoughts, and am just in a weird situation right now. 

I‚Äôd like to figure out how to get back to how I was a month ago, where I was absolutely loving my life. It‚Äôs like there was this sudden switch and now I‚Äôm just always panicking and thinking I‚Äôm now depressed or something out of the blue. 

The only thing that‚Äôs changed with me is these sinus issues that won‚Äôt go away with medicine. Could this all be attributed to this?

I see a lot of misinformation (sometimes hateful in nature) and bad advice on here that will only serve to make those experiencing distress from intrusive thoughts worsen. 

If you are experiencing distress from unwanted intrusive thoughts (often disturbing in content) you are not alone! 94% of people admit to experiencing such thoughts, but not all ‚Äútune in‚Äù and pay them attention. 

Intrusive thoughts are a product of over policing thoughts, and thus, are the opposite of impulses, though when the amygdala fires off, the brain experience ‚Äúthought-action blur‚Äù which temporarily weakens the mind‚Äôs ability to differentiate between thoughts and actions. You can identify intrusive thoughts because they seem ‚Äúalien‚Äù- you do not want to be having them and they make you uncomfortable or distressed. 

Once you recognize what an intrusive thought is, remember: thoughts cannot be harmful or dangerous, though the anxiety often makes it seem that way. They are just thoughts. They do not equal reality. You are not your thoughts. If you fight them, they will fight back, and often become recurring (or ‚Äústick‚Äù). ‚ÄúWhat you resist persists‚Äù. Your brain will return to try and solve a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist and can‚Äôt be solved. ‚ÄúNeurons that fire together wire together‚Äù. Reassuring yourself with false comfort (i.e. listing all the reasons you‚Äôre not a bad person) will never satisfy the worried mind and serves to reinforce the intrusive thought. Knowing they are a product of over controlling the thoughts (telling them they can‚Äôt happen), instead accept that they are happening and allow them to happen. Just ‚Äúfloat and feel‚Äù. Don‚Äôt suppress or repress, just watch yourself experience the thoughts and feelings. Let time pass. 
Intrusive thoughts will happen again, it is the nature of the mind, but you can equip yourself with attitudes and skills to rewire how your brain reacts to them. They are false fear constructs that your amygdala reacts to. You can‚Äôt control that they happen, or even the initial ‚Äúunthinking‚Äù reaction to them, but you can learn to respond afterward. 

If you are experiencing severe emotional distress or social thoughts, please let someone try and help you. I apologize that the information cannot be more exhaustive- please take an inverted interest in helping yourself and finding good help.

I've spent a lot of time in the mental healthcare system, and ultimately nothing worked for me besides discovering spirituality. I've been sober for 1.5 years now and while I still have bad days, life is overall better for me now.

However. I can't get these stupid fucking intrusive thoughts out of my head. Sometimes I'll be lying in bed with him and I just hear in my head, repeating, ""call him the n word, call him the n word! Do it! Call him the n word!!!!"" And in order to quell it I have this weird pattern I do in my head where there's 4 spaces and each space can hold a letter in it and I spell out words in a tapping manner. Sometimes it gets so overwhelming that I have to leave the conversation.

I really, really don't think I'm a racist. I hope I'm not racist. I just can't get it out of my head and it scares me half to death because I'm afraid I'm going to let it slip one day and ruin everything.

I don't want to tell him about it because I feel so ashamed.

Just a little backstory: I have what i consider to be severe pocd (never been officialy diagnosed, but my former therapist said i did) that comes with many symptoms. Rumination, Reassurance, (what I hope is) false attraction, ect. I used to have alot of anxiety in the first month or two of dealing with it, but now it is all gone it feels like. I remember not being able to eat or sleep and do anything but seek reassurance and ruminate all day. I honestly don't know what changed, it's like one day I woke up and the anxiety was gone. I remember when it first happened I used to work myself up to the point where I would kind of 'force's myself to get anxious and cry and stuff. Now very few (if any) things my pocd throws at me seems to cause me anxiety. I'm worried ERP therapy won't help me and I'll be stuck like this forever. I want ERP therapy to work, I want anxiety but at the same time it feels like I'm lying, even as I write this.
I remember before this I never really thought of kids, never liked or hated them. They were just there. Now I feel lost and ""off"" most of the time and I don't know how to fix it. I want my normal attraction and interests back. I'm suffering everyday, just going through the motions.

Also some people say that ocd is an anxiety disorder while some don't,  I'm honestly so confused and don't know what to think. 

So my question is: Has anyone had pocd and recovered with ali greymond? And can she help me even though my anxiety is gone? Can I get better?

Don\'t ever rush it because all it will do is frustrate you.\n\nThe light will come soon enough and when it does, the results will be even more amazing then you thought originally.\n\nThis should begin to make you more and more happy as you start seeing it done.\n\nThe important part is you have complete power and control over it so that means that anything else that is going on around you can ever connect to what you are creating.\n\nThere may be stress from your job and/or personal family life that you are gradually trying to take care of during the time you dedicate towards that but your goal is what you look forward to every chance you have for it because you know it is the right thing for you.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nYou get the point, you need something for you in life if you don\'t already have that.

I learned how to control it as I grew up, but it used to be a big problem I got sent to juvenile twice because of it. Every time I bring it up to someone they think it's not a big deal because I don't want to tell them the whole story. They will think I'm crazy. I can't ever tell someone I get so angry I bash my steering wheel and scream at the top of my lungs ""kill kill kill"" the one time I did the guy didn't take me seriously. I don't want to hurt anyone but it's like everything builds up and I can't tell anyone about it no one wants to hear it and i dont blame them. I started losing friends because nobody cares and it gets tiring for them. So I stopped telling people things I stopped losing friends but for some reason I couldn't be around them without feeling sad and suicidal. After months of working 60hrs a week and never hanging out anymore I started to lose more friends because i didnt spend time with them. That's when I started cutting my arms and legs. It was in places nobody would see. I had excuses if they did see them somehow. After learning about my past 2 attempts they wanted me to tell them things more but I can't do it. I tell them the bare minimum but its pointless selfish and stupid I just wish I didn't have problems. I end up unleashing all my anger onto a heavy bag. The only thing that made me calm when I got home was having my buddy here with me. He was a good boy and he passed away because of me. I got drunk and overdosed on 70g of ibuprofen a few weeks ago and woke up in my sleep throwing it up and passed out on my bed. I think he got some of it and he passed from either kidney or liver failure. I took him to the vet and on the way there I played my favorite Playlist in the car and prayed to God to help my buddy. The vet said there's basically nothing he could do and gave him a shot of Depo Medrol. Which is a steroidal anti inflamitory. I don't know if that couldve made it worse but he didnt seem like he was going to pass away. It was very sudden. When he passed I felt so angry and guilty. I prayed to God to save my dog and punish me not him. When he passed I think I lost faith in that bastard piece of shit God. What the fuck good has he ever done for me. My many years of faith and all he has done is take away my dog, my grandpa, and made me feel the things I do. I couldn't even listen to my favorite music without being reminded of my dog passing away because of me. I felt so guilty the same night he passed I drank a bottle of lighter fluid and went speeding hoping to get pulled over to use my knife and get shot. Nobody pulled me over even though I passed by 2 cops going 60 in a 30. At one point I was going 120mph in a 50. I was going to order needles and potassium chloride. I haven't done it. But I need to know if this will ever go away, I just want to be left alone but not physically if that makes sense. I almost killed myself out of guilt and desperation a month ago when I stole a gun from my grandmas and rented a hotel room at a beach. I tried to shoot myself at the beach and in the hotel but I couldn't do it. It made my problems seem miniscule when I was about to pull the trigger the last time. I pulled it 3 times and didn't do it on the last one. The thought of going home and chilling with my buddy was enough to make me put the gun down. I attempted suicide 4 times in my life and half way attempted 2 times. People only know about the last two. Since with the gun I chickened out, I will not get that opportunity again for a long time. I had to tell them because it was their gun. And my buddy passed away. I couldn't keep that a secret out of respect for him. I know I'm not just angry, I'm sad, exhausted, and just ready for this shit be through. What is all of this even for in the first place. For a while I held a knife to my stomach every night in hopes I would get the courage to just do it but I never could because I am a wimp.

I'm 19, I am entering a CNA program and next month is my first class. Recently I noticed I can ignore the negative thoughts but it feels like something is missing. And when I'm by myself especially at night in my room I think about it again and it feels bad but the thing that felt wrong like it was missing doesnt feel missing anymore. It makes me want to Curl into a ball and I sometimes grip my arm very hard because it's just a difficult thought to have but I feel like I should not be alive. And when someone is there for me and tells me things I like to hear i know I don't deserve them I've done nothing with my life so far except be a burden literally. It's painful to ignore it and painful to acknowledge it. I don't know what to do. I hate the mental hospital, I have been there twice before and it only made me worse. The experience was negative both times. If I ever have to go back there again I'm doing as much damage as possible the people taking me so please do not report this for any reason.",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,90406,public,self,What do I do now?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/uulyta/what_do_i_do_now/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my day to day I don't come across as very empathetic. And I've no issues being harsh online. But I do have a lot of empathy which I fight not to overwhelm me. But sometimes the smallest things trigger it.

One is the damned reddit avatars. Anytime I see them I immediately feel the need to protect and cuddle the person on the other side.

I remember once being a bit mean and telling someone off on reddit and they were apologetic like ""Oh okay. I'm sorry for misunderstanding, I have trouble with this sometimes.""

Normally I'd just be like ""That's okay"" and anger would blow over. But seeing the feckin reddit avatar beside the apology just broke me! Like I hurt the most precious thing in the world.

Even at work people use these human avatars with small bodies and big heads and when I see them I immediately feel empathy for the person on the other side.

There was even once I saw people posting some really cringey things on Twitter but when I saw the interactions it was just a bunch of nice cartoonish avatars enjoying themselves and I was overcome with the feeling of ""I just want people to be happy.""

Seriously, I'm supposed to be a hard ass but every now and then these damned avatars and reddit people pop into my head and I start wondering how these people are doing and hope things are okay and this bugs the HELL out of me.

I've had severe separation anxiety since I was very little and it's only gotten worse as I've been with my boyfriend, and so I am now very codependent as is he. I have terrible general, social, and health anxiety and bouts of depression with suicidal thought. Terrible, violent anger issues and mood swings. Possible and likely borderline personality disorder and I have a hunch that my ""giftedness"" I've been told about since I was very young is actually undiagnosed autism. I am all around very rarely pleasant to be around.

I think all of this extrapolates, or may be extrapolated by, my intrusive thoughts. I absolutely adore animals with the entire fiber of my being, I want to be a veterinarian and have been wanting that since I was very young, but I often have intrusive thoughts about hurting my dogs, my cat. When I used to own rats, I would cry cause I couldn't stop the thoughts about swinging them by their tails against the wall. Obviously, these are incredibly distressing thoughts and I'd never act on them, but they make me feel terrible. I love my mom, she's the strongest, most hard-working person I've ever met in my entire life. Intrusive thoughts scream at me to stab her and watch her bleed out. My boyfriend, an absolute saint. The most kind, intelligent, empathetic person on the planet. Intrusive thoughts tell me to kill him, cook him, eat him.

The least distressing are the thoughts about myself, slitting my wrists or ripping my teeth out or slicing off my fingers. Still distressing, but I care less about what happens to me than to my animals, my mom, my boyfriend, etc. I'd never act on these things, of course, not in a million years. But the fact that the thoughts even cross my mind at all fucking destroys me from the inside out. I should be imprisoned for even thinking these incredibly disturbing, disgusting things, even if I really know I have no control over this. I know it's not me.

I have gotten so much better since then, to the point that I‚Äôm no longer laying in bed all day and night in states of depression, but the pain and intrusive thoughts still lingers where I feel it control my livelihood and wellbeing to a decent degree.

I have wondered how likely it is that I have OCD, this would be the wake up call for me if I did get diagnosed with it. I just started seeing a psychiatrist for the first time ever a month ago and they prescribed me Wellbutrin to enhance my Celexa prescription I‚Äôve been taking, but I don‚Äôt feel they‚Äôre adequately aware of how incredibly destroyed my life has been since last summer. 

I have a therapist, and he has been unable to accurately pinpoint whether or not I have OCD or if it‚Äôs GAD, which he leans closer towards. I think next time I see the psychiatrist I‚Äôm going to practically beg them to refer me to an OCD specialist who can give me a test to see what the results are. 

The intrusive thoughts have basically made this girl the be all-end all of every facet of my life. She got angry and frightened of me continuously contacting her and told me off and to leave her alone. I‚Äôm glad she didn‚Äôt file a restraining order against me. I don‚Äôt hold anything against her because she had gotten out of an abusive relationship prior to seeing me with an ex who stalked her and would possibly harm her if he found out where her new living situation was. 

Anyways, the intrusive thoughts are always involving her, but they have varying levels of radical-ness/extreme-ness. There‚Äôs the basic thoughts like what is she doing now? Who is she dating? Is she getting married? How is she doing emotionally/financially? Is she happier than I am now? Is she doing better than I am?

Then the intrusive thoughts take on more of an edge: is she getting wasted and hooking up with strangers at bars? Is she having trashy hotel sex with guys taking advantage of her? Is she going to get knocked up with some random guy‚Äôs baby? Is she hanging around with guys who banter on the local neighborhood street corner and going back to their place to sleep with them? Is she having an affair with anyone? Is she having spontaneous hook ups like you would see in porn? Hell, is she doing porn? 

Then there‚Äôs intrusive thoughts where she still has a say or involvement in my life, nearly a year after we stopped talking, like what would she say about me talking to or dating this other person? What would she think of my new job or any other endeavors I‚Äôm doing? Oh no, I have a health complication, I need to tell her about it and get her opinion. 

I felt like this was the only sub I could post these things to because any other sub like dating or relationship advice would be negative about these thoughts I have. Obviously I can‚Äôt go to this girl about these thoughts because she is extremely uncomfortable with me and she would only react angrily and probably get creeped out that I‚Äôm still thinking about her almost a year after us seeing each other. Even my friend that introduced us to each other has become noticeably concerned about how much I have been affected by this. Some nights I wake up in a state of panic wondering how on Earth I have gotten to such a state of obsession with another person and allowed myself to be consumed by such a minor fling. It scares me just as much as I‚Äôve scared this person.

Please give me any support or guidance that you can. I feel like a crazy person over this girl. I‚Äôve had the most suicidal thoughts I‚Äôve ever had in my life this past year. I wish I had one of those memory erasers from Men in Black that could wipe all involvement Ive had with this girl.

We have been together for over 4 years. We used to live together but she took an overdose in January so we decided it would be best for her to move back home with her mother whilst she recovered and went through therapy etc. She lives about 2 hours drive away, so I go to see her at weekends like I used to before we moved in together. I have suffered with terrible anxiety for years along with Retroactive Jealousy disorder and intrusive thoughts. I had got good at blocking out these things, but with her living away, I have slowly slipped back into it. I have recently started therapy for this, which has re opened a lot of my wounds so to speak. Anyone that has experienced this will know what I mean.

The majority of my intrusive thoughts and anxieties are sexual, graphic mental movies or sexual thoughts of not being good enough or satisfying her, so she has to find someone else etc. She's never really been overly sexual and hasn't masturbated much before. I know I can make her finish through oral or using my hands/fingers etc, but when we have penetrative sex I finish quite fast, not prematurely but a few minutes I'd say, which can't be enjoyable for her even if she says it is. I should also say that due to the age difference she has had previous partners, whereas she was my first proper sexual partner. My biggest insecurities are all around sex. I have anxieties like, am I good enough? Does she enjoy it? When she closes her eyes, is she thinking of other people? Do I compare to her exes? So on and so forth.

I was kinda dealing with that and getting on with it but recently she has got more sexual, which was good for me, even though I thought it had come out of nowhere. But then the other day I found some toys that she uses on her own and doesn't want us to use them together. Which obviously triggered my anxiety and insecurities massively, so I caved in and had to ask her. It was a calm conversation as we never raise our voice or argue aggressively. She told me that I do satisfy her but when it's on her own she is able to clear her mind, enjoy it and not worry about making me finish too. I asked if she thinks of other people or anything like that and she says no, but then my head tells me she would say that even if it wasn't the case. So I can't win. She says she just reads erotica, but then that also hits my insecurities as I don't masturbate or watch porn at all these days, as she is all I want. Would that not mean I am not enough if she has to use other things to stimulate her? I trust her completely and know she wouldn't be unfaithful but it plays on my mind. Asking for constant reassurance just makes things worse.

As we don't live together we can't have a face to face conversation so it's all over text as we are both busy until we can call. She got annoyed and said she wanted some time to herself before she said something she regretted, which in my head would be her saying something that confirms my insecurities.What else could she regret saying? She also said she isn't happy analyzing her sex toys and having her personal moments twisted in a way that makes me feel bad as its not fair and not ok. Which I completely agree with but I cannot help it. I don't know how to believe her when she says things, even if it's what I want to hear, my head just tells me she is just saying it.

So I would like some advice on what I should do. I am getting help for my intrusive thoughts and anxiety, but I feel that my insecurities are genuine and not a product I've made up in my mind.

But I noticed my mind will try to create an entire story thst isn't real it almost feels like and it'll latch onto random things and people. And one has really been getting to me lately, I was looking through old pictures and I found some old pictures of someone I use to be friends with.

I let it go after seeing the pictures basically. But then I had a dream where I was in a airport and I was picking my bf up and talking to my parents and when I walked off I ran into him and he said ""how heart warming"" and that was the only encounter. After that dream i woke up and my mind latched onto the dream saying that it meant something and that it means I was cheating, a bad person, etc and then since yesterday everytime I started to forget and started thinking about my bf, my mind would be like ""you haven't figured out the dream yet"" and then my bfs face would be replaced with his and then itd be so distressing that I kind of just have to hold my head and wait for it to go away and then deal with guilt after. I know I don't want these thoughts, but it almost feels like its nit even really about the guy, but instead he's associated with anxiety now so he's the face of my anxiety kind of thing and this happens everytime it feels like my mind latches onto someone.. anyone else relate or have anything that helps this because even though I know I don't want this I still feel guilt for it and if it stays long enough I start believing that its wanted and not intrusive which is even more scary",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,90303,public,self,intrusive thoughts latching onto people?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/unssz2/intrusive_thoughts_latching_onto_people/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I often find myself dwelling on things and I cannot stop obsessing. Usually stems from saying something I regret, because it came off differently then I intended.

I cannot make them stop. I make myself feel ill. I make myself cry. I make these people in my head say and do such mean things, I hurt my own feelings. It causes a lot of anxiety.

I am diagnosed generalized anxiety, adhd, and ""mood disorder""
I take Lamictal (bipolar meds, however I don't think meet all the checks for that diagnoses) and methylphenidate  for the adhd daily. Not sure if that matters? 

Since being on these med I feel much more grounded and present. I was so easily able to zone out and be on auto pilot before, but now I feel as tho I actually have to face and deal with these things. It's been like this since I can remember tbh. There's a lot of trauma I've ignored for years that I am finally trying to over come, but that's a whole can of worms for another time.

I have been getting thoughts of if she tries to seduce me during the vacation, and what if I fall for it. This could happen with means of extortion or manipulation. Thing is, it is easy for me to be turned on.

One thing I will say is that I know for a fact I would never sexually harm a kid nor anyone  and I‚Äôm not sexually attracted to children but the fact that these disturbing images keep playing in my mind makes me sick to my stomach. Earlier last year I was staying at a relatives who‚Äôs children are like my children. I take them to school get them dressed change them etc and I love the hell out of them and the only thing I want to ever see them do Is win and make it in this world. One day (under the influence) I had a random thought come to mind of someone harming one of the children and I instantly thought that‚Äôs fucked up why would I think of that. But I kept it pushing ,maybe 2-3 weeks later I had a nightmare someone who bullied me as a kid sexually abused my cousin who is like my own kid and I woke up heart racing chest tight and lightheaded. Even though it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs business but the child I love as if he was my own is non verbal autistic and my biggest fear is someone harming him ,whether it‚Äôs physical sexual or whatever just downright taking advantage of him not being able to talk. I went to work and told a coworker about the scary dream and thought it was done. But now let‚Äôs talk about hell. I would sleep in the basement and the kids sometimes would randomly come down to play video games or just bother me but im grown and sometimes I want that alone time to masturbate or be on the phone. but i used to be scared because I never knew when they would come down there and I don‚Äôt want them walking in on me. So with that fear always on my mind I guess I would have random moments where they‚Äôd be on my mind while I‚Äôm pleasuring myself. I wouldn‚Äôt think of them In a sexual sense but the fear of getting caught. It started being that after a while of having that constant fear I began seeing these unwanted images of people harming them and I was grossed out and it made me sad. Now I thought It was over but then I had these images of me doing it and I immediately felt sick I remember thinking ‚ÄúI know I would never‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a pedophile‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to hell‚Äù etc. these images happend every blue moon. One day I was laying nude in my bed sound asleep when I woke up my cousin (who I mentioned is like my own kid) was asleep next to me. I immediately rushed and put clothes on. I thought he was upstairs in bed but I forget sometimes he gets up in the middle of the night to find someone to lay with. I was so scared and began overthinking ‚Äúhis mom is going to think I did something to him‚Äù I was truly in a ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what it looks like‚Äùmoment. After some time once again these damn Unwanted intrusive thoughts began to Rome and they started fucking up my life. When I would take the kids to school and see the other children all I could see was someone harming them , I had so much anxiety to the point I felt as if I couldn‚Äôt breathe so I started isolating myself from the kids and a lot of my family,tried weed and alcohol to calm me down which at first was working but slowly began to make things worse. I truly believed that I was in hell. I know I‚Äôm not into kids I know I wouldn‚Äôt harm them so why would these thoughts keep happening. I didn‚Äôt want to be around anyone I felt like I had been losing my mind. I felt so alone I felt sick I felt like a monster just a sick person. Like don‚Äôt you have thoughts only about things you want ? What makes it worse is I literally would just disappear from most spaces because I know kids would be present. I know I wouldn‚Äôt harm anyone but the more people were around the more thoughts I would have. I would ask if this was a punishment I‚Äôd pray everyday that these thoughts would stop everytime I see a sex scene or anything sexual related a kid would pop up in my mind,Family members just so many despicable thoughts. I dread being around kids and what makes matters worse is I can‚Äôt exactly explain my situation to ppl out of fear they would think I‚Äôm a pedophile or that I would try to harm their kids. I‚Äôve managed to tell some people and they completely understand (at least that‚Äôs what they tell me idk if they might be lying) I‚Äôm going to therapy but my therapist just asks generic questions and I fear I won‚Äôt ever be able to see my babies again and also think people can see my problems. This is killing me I just want it all to stop I wake up every morning noon and night not breathing shaking and overthinking. I just want to die sometimes cuz I feel like a evil sick person.

I just wanted to take the time to type down my thoughts for both must and other people to read them.

Almost a year ago in April, I last posted here. If you are interested in reading it, it's the first post on my profile. But I will give you a quick rundown of what I had to say.

Basically, my thoughts came in the form of pure OCD.  What the thoughts was phrases that would repeat in my head over and over again, like a catchy song on loop. And these phrases were truly horrible. Most had to do with sexual things, phrases repeating in my head like ""imagine you and your mom having hot sex,"" or something like that (I'm not saying that phrase specifically, but things along that name) These thoughts would be about anyone and everyone. Random people on the street, babies, family members. Hell, I couldn't even read people's names on the internet without thinking those kinds of thoughs about them. My biggest fear was ""They don't know this random person is thinking said thoughts about them right now.""  It was like that everyday for a while and as a 16 year old, I freaked the fuck out (as you could imagine).

It's now almost a year later. I am not sure if my intsuvie thoughts got better or not.

For one, the phrases in my head no longer bother me as much. They don't repeat in my head all the time like they once did. Even when they do, I don't think too deeply into them and only think of them as random, meaningless words. Of course, there are times where I relapse for a bit, and try to replace the bad phrase with a good one and it starts the cycle over again for a bit. But overall, they don't bother me nearly as much as they did.

As far as going out in public goes, it has gotten much much better, actually. I went to go out and visit a family member for the weekend twice last month. I was going to go today, but just didn't feel the energy to do so. Last week (or it was most likely the week before the last) went out in public twice that week for a job placement program. Hardly thought aboht any intsuvie thoughts, only a little bit which was amazing.

Only thing is I still can't look at babies.

Now I would say I have improved, but I'm not so sure.

Now I've sort of devoloped fears in consequence to my previous thoughts. Now, I have sort of have a fear of thinking those thoughts at all. So I kinda get scared of thinks that may trigger those thoughts and feelings happening again.


For example, when I hear my family members moving around or talking, specifically in the morning for some reason. I get scared that even that may trigger the thought to happen again. 

I also have a sort of fear around being around my older brother. This may be because he has a history and issues that I'd rather not get into that makes me feel extremely guilty thinking intsuvie thoughts about him specifically. So I try my best to avoid him a lot in general, which sucks. I avoid also looking people in the face and my counselers face on video chat because I fear thinking of those thoughts I hope that gets better. I bought some earplugs in an effort to help ease the situation.

More recently as in like this year, because the words repeating in my head stopped bothering me as much, my brain has resorted to pushing images in my head that I don't want to think. Like I guess as some last resort in an effort to get me to obsess over something again. (Lol)

And it worked. My mom recently started staying in the living room, and to get into the kitchen I would have to go through her. So everytime I try to walk past her, an image would flash inside of my head that I didn't want to think and I hated it. Or when I'm in the kitchen with her or something, the images would try to flash in my head to anger me. Or when anytime something upsetting was happening, the images would flash into my head and I would get more upset, things like that.

However, I am using past tense for that because it HAS gotten better.

Like, it's like my brain trained itself to make those images in my head stop appearing so easily. Now those images take much more effort to think up. Sure, it makes it harder to imagine things, but it feels so much better. Sure, I still relapse now and again, but its still much easier to handle than before. The human brain is amazing, isn't it?

The most recent thing I am struggling with is having an incredibly negative mindset, to the point where I can't enjoy things.

For example, let's say I'm jacking off or something, I can't stop guilt tripping myself over mundane things like ""You didn't call your grandmother this week, you're jacking off instead of calling your grandmother"". Or when I'm drawing or something ""Why are you drawing instead of doing your homework?"" ""Why are you drawing when you didn't walk outside today"" ""Why are you drawing when you didn't brush your teeth?"" Or when I make a simple mistake, I can't stop obsessing over it and guilt tripping myself.

Basically, I devoloped a really bad habit of guilt tripping myself whenever I do something I enjoy. 

Another thing is whenever I like something, I can't help but ruin it for myself.

Say for example, I'm watching a movie right. I like it and I love it. Well then after a while, I can't stop thinking about the movie's flaws to the point where I cant enjoy it anymore. Or I obsess over the opinions of others that I disagree with. Even if a large amount of people agree with me, I can stop thinking about the opinions I dislike.

Those are the most recent ones I'm dealing with currently. I just cannot stop thinking and obsessing about the negative things, even if there are an overwhelming amount of positive things to consider. It's like if 99 people share the same opinion as me, I can't stop thinking or obsessing over that 1 person that disagrees. I don't want to think about it, but I can't help but think about it. If anyone has any suggestions about how to stop thinking negative and to focus on the positive and stop guilt tripping myself I would love to hear it.

Anyways, that's about it. I think I will make another post sometime later about my most recent issue. I'll update if there are any changes or progress.

It‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt love my wife and kids even if my relationship wasn‚Äôt that healthy. I was just so lost in my own head and hated myself to the core. I never felt good enough. Like I‚Äôm not enough and idk that i ever will be. 

Last year I deployed and that‚Äôs when I hit my rock bottom. I asked for a divorce, slept with another woman (thinking my marriage was the issue), and I drank heavily for a solid 3 months. Everyday. Every night. I enjoyed the numbness. I returned home from that deployment and continued the drinking. Got put on antidepressants which only intensified the drunk. Began snorting other pills just to take it up a notch because the drinking wasn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. I began to see other women and begin the process of selling our house to move on from my marriage. I then began to regret my decision after sleeping with a few women. The grass wasn‚Äôt necessarily greener on the other side. I wanted to try again to fix my marriage and get some help but my wife met this guy at a bar that she became excited about. At first I acted like I supported it because I was a piece of shit and felt she deserved better than me. Deep down I didn‚Äôt want that at all. I began to watch my wife of 6 years fall for another man in the matter of weeks. 

That‚Äôs when my suicidal thoughts began to consume my mind. I felt I was the problem and I was the one in the way of everyone‚Äôs happiness. I felt her and my kids would be better off without me. Plus if I killed myself they‚Äôd get 400k of life insurance for them to start a fresh life with. My plan was to blow my brains out in my shower with the door locked so my kids wouldn‚Äôt be the ones to find me. I wrote out letters to each of them apologizing and gave them my hopes and dreams for them along with some last minute fatherly life advice. 

The night I had planned to do it I was supposed to have the house to myself but my wife asked for me to watch the kids while she went out on a date with that guy. Which ended up saving my life. I got as far as putting the barrel in my mouth and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it because my kids would have woke up from the gunshot. 

The very next day I had a psychiatric appointment and I broke down. Told them everything. They immediately put me into a psychiatric hospital. The hospital had a program for military members and first responders that focused in on trauma and substance abuse. I was there for 2 months and got the help I desperately needed. 

Feeling like a new man I asked my wife to give me another chance.. she didn‚Äôt. She moved out of our house and took the kids with her to go live with this man while I was in that program. I came home to an empty house.

While I do feel much better, I still struggle with my suicidal thoughts everyday. I just want the struggle to stop. I want to feel like I‚Äôm not trapped in a life I don‚Äôt want to live anymore.",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,89944,public,self,Needed to get this out of me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/ujscn8/needed_to_get_this_out_of_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had a dream a few weeks ago that replayed something very disturbing that happened in my childhood. and it was my grandad watching me get changed through the crack in the door, I didn't tell anyone but I think my grandmother found out he was doing it and always got me to ""cover up"" around him if what I was wearing was too short even though I was extremely young (5-7 ish) and she always made sure I had ""appropriate"" clothing on so ""grandad wouldn't have to worry""

I had completely forgotten this happened in my life, and now I remember it vividly I've had these intrusive thoughts when  around people younger than me, it hasn't been helping that my boyfriend is younger than me (only by 6 months).
I'm worried I'm getting aroused by children and I'm having these horrible thoughts, I generally think about killing myself when I have these thoughts and I can't feel comfortable in a room with kids it makes me want to puke. 
My last relationship I was in was ruined because of my issues with self harm (I only did it places no one could see, but obviously my boyfriend at the time saw it). 
All I want to do is hurt myself but I can't out of fear of losing my current boyfriend. It would ruin our relationship as it did my last. 

I don't think I can go on any longer, I can't talk to anyone about this I don't wanna have to wait for months and months just to get therapy (in the UK you have to wait for ages for care like this because it's free) 
I don't think I can't wait and I feel so disgusted and ashamed of myself for having such thoughts. If I see people younger than me I have such bad intrusive thoughts that in the moment I would think killing myself would be the best option, I just want a fast way out of this mess, I can't tell anyone I know that would understand what I'm going through, they will assume I'm a peadophile and abandon me even though I will never do anything to hurt anyone.

So basically I want to get better and sorry if this post doesn't make sense (I would blame it on my diagnosed at 6, Dyslexia but nah, just me) or it being very long

So a little but might not be so little story about myself


 So I've tried hobbies like writing or knitting or playing games, usually only distract me for a sort amount of time with my thoughts, so yeah not very good

I'm 19, female, in college which want to go back for another year, to do fine art or whatever the art course I want to do last year is called (gotten back into being interested in becoming a tattoo artist might never get that job but it always have interested me) but because of thoughts, I kind of want to leave, like right now leave but only have like a month left so kind if staying until ended

Even though I seem alright on the outside even though my Bf knows my thoughts, which noticed tell him makes me feel more guilty or makes them worse, the were alright a few days ago but since being away from him, yeah they get worse (especially the thought were I question myself - have I cheated, which no. Or will I cheat, which no even if I am the H word, not the hungry word but hope you get my indication but yeah, I get the H word alot at certain times of the year or lack of H word) 

So yeah you can see I am mental or least have mental health issues, not good at describing so might not seem all that bad except for a few here's and there. Oh and I was depressed as a teen and now has come back because of the thought, promised the Bf to never cut again, it either that or us breaking up, so yeah, never doing that even if the thought comes into my head because don't want to ever lose him

I had a eating problems as a younger teen, went back into it for a week or two, like last week but got back into eating normally or eating my emotions again

Oh by the way meditation doesn't work, gets me thinking more plus can't sit still so that won't work

I just wonder, if I am a good person or not because I dont feel like it at times. Do you think I am especially that I feel guilt for what I think?

A few days ago Bf broke up with me, only took a few hours until he made a decision and shocking got back with me, I don't want that to happen again, I can't lose him, I love him and I am scared of losing him again but these thoughts at times get out of control and the urge to tell him is there. When he asks whats wrong he doesn't care about the thoughts and wants me to tell him the truth, but repeatedly talking about the thoughts for hours make us both tired/exhausted, can't deal with each other and depressed

I just want to get better, I don't have money seeing as unempolyed, trying to find a job but it's hard, getting rejections all the time. So no therapy for me, tried NHS wise but didn't work once aka they did nothing and the other time tried, got no contact, so sort of gave up that way

I just need help, even if it's someone to talk to or have help in ways of coping, like distractions or anything really because I am tried and out of ideas on how to control these thoughts that sometimes I think death is an option which don't worry, I ain't going to because I have someone I love in my life aka the BF but I want to be a better person, I can't always just rely on him all the time

so i‚Äôve had what i think are intrusive thoughts for years, really horrible stuff, but i‚Äôve managed to deal with it myself. 

this is something completely different. it is nowhere near as awful is the rest of it. it isn‚Äôt something that would really disturb people if i said it out loud. but it is also the hardest to deal with out of them all. 

so i‚Äôve had this teddy for as long as i can remember. it‚Äôs only of the only constant things in my life that doesn‚Äôt break. that no matter how many times i lose him he always comes back. one of the only truly perfect things i have. 

but i lost him for a while. just a bit too long. turns out he was under my bed hidden behind something, where it was dusty and cobwebby. 

i have this thing where when i try to sleep, sometimes i can just see spiders all around me. i can feel them crawling on me. inside of me. and they don‚Äôt go away unless i turn on my light and distract myself on my phone or something. it really fucks up with my sleep. 

but this teddy. the only thing i‚Äôve really been able to truly rely on, has started to make its way into these stupid spider ‚Äòdreams‚Äô. when i try to sleep when he‚Äôs near me, when he‚Äôs on my bed, all i can think about is the fact that while he was under my bed in the cobwebs a spider had laid its eggs into him and that they‚Äôre gonna hatch out of him. 

i know this isn‚Äôt real. that it didn‚Äôt actually happen. but i can‚Äôt stop the thoughts from coming and ducking with everything. 

it happens every single time i try to sleep with him on my bed. 
the one thing that was there for me my entire childhood has been ruined.
it‚Äôs the only intrusive thought that has really affected me in such a negative way. 
and i don‚Äôt know how to deal with it. i don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôm supposed to get rid of them. to fix it. i really need to fix it. 
i don‚Äôt know how long i can take it with these thoughts fucking up the only thing i truly lived as a kid. 

these are intrusive thoughts right? is there something wrong with me? 
like this is nowhere near the worst of them, but it‚Äôs the one that hursts the most.
is there a way to fix it? to stop these thoughts from happening. i just want to be able to sleep with the teddy i‚Äôve had for 15 years again. i just want the thoughts to stop.",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,89761,public,self,can someone please help with this or give me some advice on who to talk to. i really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. i‚Äôm just sick of it.

But then by looking at these thing I give myself anxiety bc these r wat trigger me ngl
I had forced myself to watch a show bc it had the word heart in it and a few scenes had a doctor doing a heart transplant and even tho I know that when I look at human body stuff like that I get super queasy and feel like crying, I still forced myself to watch it bc I felt it would happen to me if I didn‚Äôt 

Just now I was looking something up and the word stroke appeared and I forced myself to look at 2 articles and then forced myself to stop looking at them bc it would make me feel worse but now I‚Äôm still getting anxiety bc I didn‚Äôt look at all the articles my eyes saw and now my mind is saying I‚Äôm going to have one as ‚Äúkarma‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt seen him since sixth grade (I‚Äôm graduating HS now) and I don‚Äôt know why but I struggled processing his death. In fact, I still do. Maybe it‚Äôs because I moved across the country or because I haven‚Äôt seen him in six years but I haven‚Äôt once cried/mourned his death. I stare at pictures of him, play old memories of him in my head, but no matter how much I try to force myself to feel the way I‚Äôm supposed to feel about a late friend, I never cry. 

One night, while under the influence of cannabis, i had a terrible thought in my head: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about his death because he was black.‚Äù I felt terrible. I don‚Äôt know if it was the weed but my mind had convinced myself that this was the reason I didn‚Äôt mourn and that I was a racist. When i disregarded this thought it came back 10 fold, festering in my head and filling me with guilt.

The main trigger for this guilt was either seeing or listening to POC. Sometimes I think I‚Äôve ‚Äúcracked‚Äù the code to my thoughts and that I have grown out of them but then they come back and so does the guilt. I listen to rap music everyday by African-American artists but I can never truly enjoy it because I have a pit in my stomach that will always form whenever I‚Äôm listening to it. I‚Äôm sick and tired of this and it‚Äôs ruining my life. 

That ‚Äòone night‚Äô I referred to at the beginning of this post was 4 months ago and now I am guilt-ridden everyday. I just want to know if anyone out there has been in a situation like this and how to deal with it. I believe that all people are equal and if I could shoot a Klansman in the face I would but now my brain has made me it‚Äôs own worst enemy.

Caution this is a long text.

To start of I had been sick for a while early 2020 with lots of nausea, and to this day I am sure it was part of my period symptoms. When I went to my doctor, he said it could come from a hidden depression, since he knows my family and that I had seen a therapist before about anxiety already. I thought ""okay I am a little depressed, I can fix that"".

Barely a week later, when I was alone at home, nausea struck me again. I felt weak, tired, and stressed out from it. And I had the single thought ""why am I still putting up with this?""

My anxiety was awakened. I questioned this thought. Why would I think that, I don't want to die! Stop overrreacting! My anxiety grasped this thought and many more. I kept overrreacting. Every little thing I did was an idea how to end myself. Take the matches, burn the house. Ride my bike, get run over by a car. It all seemed so scary, I didn't want this, where did these thoughts come from?

I sought my therapist after just a year of leaving therapy. She assured me these were intrusive thoughts, not my own. Not what I wanted. Not anything I'd go and listen to. It calmed me. I got prescriped Mirtazapin, something to help me sleep since I suffered insomnia from all the overthinking. Since covid just started I stopped college, spent half a year at home, focusing on life in front of me. I picked up a training since I needed structure in life. Things became better. I also started taking birth control to regulate my period. I started to feel overall better. Anxiety lessened. I gained back control.

Early 2021 I had a relapse, probably because I accidentally ran out of birth control for a month, causing my hormones to run wild. My thoughts became a mess again. I was shaken. What if that happened again and again? I hadn't been to my therapist in a while, so I reached out to her again. Slowly it became better again. I was scared by my thoughts but also annoyed. Trying to combat these thoughts. Yes I'm supposed to not pay attention, they are just thoughts but it was difficult. Work helped me distracting myself. And I met a bunch of online friends where I all my attention went towards.

During summer because of some stress and familial problems it gave me some sleep problems again. I had been off Mirtazapin since the beginning of 2021 which hadn't been a problem either. Now I am off birth control completely again since end of 2021. I felt that I had some down days everytime the pill cycle was about to be over and didn't wanna risk it anymore. I feared it would become worse after I stop but the first two/three months went quite well.

Now the past two months changed me. I received some worrying news about my grandparents health which made me feel down. It made my thoughts worse. They changed a little from the repetitive 'I wanna die"" and similar to ""for what do we even live"" and ""how long do I have to suffer like this"" up to ""I want a break"".

I have long developed these thoughts into ""what if this never goes away?"" and ""what if I am stuck with this forever? What if I get depressed, become that depressed that I can't take it anymore"". From early on, through media and all, you always have this connection between these two topics. They scare me.

I think my menstruation cycle, my hormones, make this stronger. Before my last period I had a big downfall for two weeks. My thoughts had been scaring me. I wanted a break so badly. I cried for the first time about this in two years, I always tried to hold myself back but couldn't that day. I am so scared of being weak, of giving up. And just when I cried, I had two minutes of bliss, started laughing about my own stupidity of not having cried before, only to get a burst of anxiety right after.

After my period was over, I had the best three weeks for a while. Suddenly my thoughts were minor, quiet, it was wonderful. I didn't care about them. No anxiety, silent sleep, no worries. I told myself like this I could live forever.

Then PMS stabbed me. I noticed it at work. From one day to the other, I couldn't shake off a thought as easily. Noticed a slight lack of motivation.

Two days ago it happened then. Sometimes there's nights where I wake up and can't fall asleep anymore because of the thoughts. But... That night I woke up 4/5am, in the span of two minutes the thoughts jumped at me, my anxiety jumped at them, wrecked me. I tried to distract myself only to force myself to go to work with shaking legs and exhaustion a couple hours later. It didn't let go of me. I couldn't focus on my work, couldn't talk much to my colleagues. Couldn't pay attention, chained to the mess of my mind and my symptoms. My boss and coworkers noticed and told me to take it easy, get some tea. I must have been pale as hell. I recovered finally after a while and it all calmed down. 

But as long as these feelings and thoughts were stuck with me, I wanted a break so bad. And the worst in that moment is my own mind telling me ""the only thing giving you a break is death"". It's not something I want to do. I want to live happily. Without these thoughts I would be happy, carefree. But for over two years straight, they have been there. It scared me. It still does. I am scared of this ocurring every month.

My therapist said to me I have to focus on the weeks of happiness I had before. I know this is a roller coaster. But this honestly just scared me. The thought scared me. I don't want this reoccurring every month like that. Because it's true I want a break from this. I am so scared to hurt myself or agree with my thoughts one day.

Intrusive thoughts can vary. I have skimmed through the threads earlier. I wonder how other people feel who have the same thoughts and fears than me. Is there someone here? Or someone who got over it? Who is free from them? How did you do it? I hear it's either never or you learn to live with it.

I don't care if I feel a little encumbered once a month. But THAT... I am so scared of giving up. Sometimes I just want to catch a break. But that's just what gives my intrusive thoughts a chance to grow again.

Otherwise I am quite happy. I enjoy my work, like my colleagues and friends, I can follow my hobbies. My therapist doesn't judge me to be depressive or ever follow my thoughts, but the past three days I just doubted myself so greatly. Even while writing this, I feel uneasy. Yesterday I left my session with her feeling uneasy.

What do you all do to control them? I did so well over these two years, why am I suddenly like this again? (I can see myself being happy again once my period is over and my anxiety dwindles) but right now I feel like a wrack.

I'll try valerian for now, see if it calms me down a little. She also said THC products might help, anything natural for now, herbal things. She said if it helps to talk to someone who cares. It does help but it also leaves me uneasy.

I don't wanna die. I don't plan on listening to my thoughts. But I am so scared I'll start getting weak and agree with them. Because I wished I could get a break. I feel exhausted right now. The thoughts are fueling my anxiety, my anxiety is fueling my thoughts, and my thoughts tell me the only way to stop these thoughts is to listen to them. Isn't that dumb? Why is it such an endless cycle for me? 

Anyway... I think this is all. My bad for making y'all read through my wall of text. I'd be glad to hear some other perspectives and stories. Even if the symptoms and thoughts are different. Maybe some comfort. Maybe some tips. Thank you for listening. I am uneasy right now but I hope some people are there and will listen to my story.",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,89476,public,self,Vomiting my experiences for comfort,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/u9i2jp/vomiting_my_experiences_for_comfort/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Always have had them but since last year around November time been getting worse, sometimes I think a part of me is doing it for attention but the other half feels like I am going Crazy. Yes I ask myself questions and a little voice says yes when a no question is being answered. Mainly I am focused on is the - am I cheating question, which for one I haven't been with my first boyfriend since May last year and is causing a problem at times these thoughts, at times cheating thoughts not me having the urges which yes I have thoughts of people just face wise in the past but I always feel guilty and tell him. I have never cheated and will never cheat but because every so often he says 'even though you are faithful to me, I sounds like you are cheating' even though he knows I am fully faithful to him and barely leave the house unless got college, going to either parents houses or his house. I have always feared someone cheating on me, never have I ever thoughts of me questioning myself and worried that my boyfriend will think that me act on it, even though promised and is against what I want. I want him and only him, no one else. I know worrying follows in the family but this, this is more than worrying because my main focus is that I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but at times he has mentioned that this could tear our relationship apart and yes he has thought of breaking up with me because I feel like I can't control my thoughts, no matter what he says, I feel so weak that I myself can't do this on my own. 

Yes I have some mental health problems which doesn't help, not diagnosed with anything but if you stay in a room with me for an hour you will notice if I fully act like myself instead of the pretendness of a mask I put up in front of people yes I might be on the spectrum as well, people have said so many time throughout my life but ignored it

Why do I get obsessed with these thoughts? ( the questions of - am I cheating, which no I am not and will never do so, because I know and believe it is wrong, I want to be with my boyfriend for like. Even though I am not religious,  my family are Catholic and always taught me in life what is right or wrong. I found my life partner and its him but I am scared that I might lose him, he is my world and he is my everything) 

I really need help, I tried to look for therapy but cost money even signed up recently for an NHS one but said will answer back in 20 days, which with my age, I believe I won't be able to get it for free, so if not, I am out of options. Tried online therapy, all have memberships or you have to atleast pay for something, I am unemployed and don't have money to spare, I am an adult who still lives with her parents and my boyfriend can't get a job either, he is struggling in that area of finding one too, plus with college on hand especially next year

I just hate myself for it all, don't worry I ain't going to harm myself or anything (got reported once because someone thought that on this app I was on, to try to speak with others who are in similar situations) 

Yes I know there are people out there who are the same but at times, I feel alone and I can't always rely on my boyfriend, he has problems of his own both family life and depression wise too and I know I talking personal stuff over Reddit, I don't care at this point and even if someone says you ain't alone, well I feel like that and I feel so alone and feel like I can't talk to anyone at all, like I am stuck in a see throu box and can't get out, as I watch people see me, try to talk to me but never able to get me out. Is it weird to always feel like I am either suffocating or drowning, is that okay?

Is it normal to be out of control especially out of control of your own mind?

It may be fairly disturbing and you might feel like a bit of a freak or a weirdo as a result. Well, guess what - you‚Äôre not! 

Intrusive/disturbing thoughts can take many forms - sometimes it can be based on fear (for example, the idea that you have a disease), anger (it might be a violent thought or a thought of self harm), inappropriate sexual thoughts, something around relationships or death. When they arrive they worry us, they can make us ask if there‚Äôs something wrong with us. Its usually something that's fundamentally at odds with who we are, what we believe and what we want to do - for example the thought of jumping off when you‚Äôre near a cliff.

And this actually helps us to understand why we experience disturbing thoughts. Many people (including me) experience the thought of jumping off when you‚Äôre near a cliff, but the intrusive thought usually isn‚Äôt our mind trying to get us to act in a particular way, rather its our mind getting us to do the opposite. We‚Äôre afraid of doing something appropriate in public so we have a thought to do something inappropriate. We want to be safe from harm, so our mind asks us ‚Äúwhat would happen if you jumped off this cliff‚Äù - to get us to back away from the edge. They can also just be a random, meaningless stream of consciousness. Intrusive thoughts are common and not a sign that there‚Äôs something wrong with you.

We can choose to see these thoughts as just that - only thoughts. In fact, intrusive or disturbing thoughts can be a helpful reminder that we are not our thoughts, they are simply something that we experience. We shouldn‚Äôt judge ourselves for having these thoughts, we shouldn‚Äôt try to fight with the thoughts or shut them out - that will only make them come more often and its where they draw their power from. Instead, we can unlock the door, let them in and accept that they exist without judgement. Sit with them for a moment. Listen to what they have to say without agreeing or disagreeing and allow them to leave, which they inevitably do. If they come again, we can do the same thing. Remember that trying to push them away is a form of attachment - we‚Äôre attached to the idea of being free of the thoughts and so we want to somehow purge them. Unfortunately that's not how our brain works - in fact the resistance is likely to make the intrusive thoughts come more often.

Its also important not to let intrusive, disturbing thoughts feed into a pattern of consumption - unwanted thoughts can drive us to look for ways to distract ourselves. Instead look at the fundamentals of your life; are you stressed out at the moment, are you spending more time alone than you usually do? Are there changes you can make that contribute towards your calmness - can you do less of the things that you know increase your anxiety or sadness like caffeine or alcohol, more of the wholesome activities that develop your wellbeing like exercise, meditation and creative activities?

Caveat - I'm not a mental health professional so do look for help from a therapist if intrusive thoughts are disrupting your daily life and making it difficult to function.

But then you remember, you are in control of your imagination where the silent devil lies. You imagine flowers blooming through the bloodshed rooms.

I've had horrible intrusive thought OCD for the past ten years practically, and every time I've felt interested girls, I've always reminded myself that I'm practically mentally ill, a basket case behind the scenes, and therefore should just forget the idea. I've always felt no young lady deserves to be with a guy as mentally unwell and unbalanced as me. 

I'm very social however, get along great with people, and just a few weeks ago, I finally did ask out a friend I've had an interest in for quite some time and while we came to a mutual understanding that we weren't fit for each other at this time, I still felt in my own mind that I am not ready yet to date anyone at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly this just makes me even more depressed because as I said, I'm mid 20s! I want to experience all the nice things other people experience in their lives! I don't want to live in a small little bedroom inflicted by depression, suicidal thoughts and oppressive, mental bullying by my OCD mind. I want to experience mutual attraction and possibly even love. But how can I change? 

&amp;#x200B;

I can keep trying to interact with people and seek to overcome my mental state, but all the horrible OCD thoughts I don't want about possible dates just makes me want to stay away from them more because I feel like such a freak, having to live with such disgusting intrusive thoughts, that bother me all the time. 

Knowing I can't do much about this voice which has been here for 10 years just makes me realize that rather than any kind of relationship, I'm left focusing on a problem that just won't go away, nor has a cure. 

What can I do? How can I rise above a constant affliction like this? I'm finally brave enough to try and ask women out on dates and be confident in myself, but I can't get rid of the voice in my mind 24/7.

It seems like a weak, fake thing to distract myself away from the truth about myself.

What if the reason these thoughts do not go away is because I do have this sexual orientation? 

Why will these thoughts not go away? 

Why did I take pleasure when masturbating and a blurred image of a young girl appeared in my mind (this happened several times)? This felt very blissful. Was it because I want that, was it because I was severely tormented and wanted out, thinking that doing so would end the thoughts somehow?

I've also masturbated to anger when my partner cheated on me (to get rid of it), shemales, men... you name it. But ultimately it seems I am only romantically and sexually interested in women my own age. But there there are these thoughts that creep in to say otherwise. And they don't go away.

Why is it that I am not checking out young girls in the street, and only women my own age?

Why is it I feel genital and body responses that could be interpreted as arousal when sometimes seeing younger girls, or even men? Or animals... but saying these things I feel as though I am lying to myself, and the answer is pedophilia.

Why do I respond to life in an anxious-lustful way?

Sometimes I see a girl from a distance and think 'wow she's pretty' then I get closer and I think 'she's too young' (even if she's actually about 18-24)? This seems normal... even if they were younger. I have the same thing with men sometimes. I will check out a man I think is a woman, realize it's a man and then laugh. That is fine... but this whole pedo-themed thing is driving me crazy.

My head is totally fucked.

Are these all just excuses for liking young girls? This is the crux of everything. This is what scares me the most and is what runs through my mind all day. When I sit alone it comes strongly. It feels as though this is the answer, and that everything else is false.

How can we actually know what is OCD and what isn't?

When I broke up with my girlfriend last year I had similar intrusive thoughts about having to break up with her. My mind is now comparing these 2 truths... one of 'I need to break up with my partner' and 'I am repressing pedophilic sexual orientation'. This is how I am trying to ascertain correct internal discernment. I am trying to see if the truths feel the same.

I am on a journey of self discovery and this just keeps showing itself so strongly. I'm kind of losing my mind. What the fuck is this and how does it fit into my life?

Anyways here‚Äôs some other ways intrusive thoughts can show up from a study i found! 


‚ÄúIn the new study, the researchers asked people with OCD to answer a questionnaire designed to understand the strength of sensory obsessions in quantifiable terms.

They found that people who had more difficulty controlling their compulsions also tended to have stronger sensory elements related to their obsessions, compared with those who had less difficulty controlling compulsions. This seemed particularly true of people whose obsessions focused on cleanliness and personal contamination, the study found.

In general, the study found that strong sensory components to obsessions also appeared more often in people with all-around vivid imaginations.

A large group of patients with OCD turned out to experience their intrusive thoughts as auditory ‚Äî arriving as whispered, spoken or shouted voices. That group of patients also tended to experience their normal thoughts as ""louder"" than most people do.

The researchers wrote that the study offers more evidence that the link between sensations and OCD has a lot of potential for treatment. If strong sensations make OCD symptoms more difficult to control, perhaps treatments based on redirecting those sensations ‚Äî which are already in the early phases of research ‚Äî could help patients better control their compulsions.‚Äù",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,89402,public,self,About intrusive thoughts and ocd! something i‚Äôd like to share,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/u2g80a/about_intrusive_thoughts_and_ocd_something_id/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

 i had unrestricted internet access at an extremely young age \[i'm talking 7 years old minimum\], which introduced me to disturbing things that i have only recently remembered/dwelled upon in the past year. these thoughts have only become more recurrent because i keep replaying disturbing shit i stumbled upon as a child, to the point of me sometimes creating false recollections within memories from my childhood that i do not remember in its entirety \[but i **know** nothing traumatic actually happened in them\]. i'm also very paranoid now. people have been telling me i am for a while now, but i can make myself anxious about anything. sometimes my paranoia is just little basic things, then i will literally ponder about the craziest shit, like accidentally killing someone or a random person on the street killing me. 

then, my intrusive thoughts started pertaining to things in my current life, convincing myself i should not be around pets or family members. yet, when i'm around these things, nothing happens. i don't have urges and i don't have disturbing thoughts/feelings.

I literally can't do anything without my mind going there, I want to take a shower and the first thought is ""what if your dad was watching you"" and i just want to die. I can't accept the possibility that this is who I am... I'm avoiding my boyfriend cause he feels like a way to think about my dad, like I'm using him or something but these thoughts bring me 0 pleasure, they've ruined who I thought I was and all the happiness I had in my life. I told my boyfriend about these thoughts and he said he supports me and that he used to have them too when he was younger but he brushed them off as disgusting and moved on. So why can't I do that as well, is it because I am in denial and I'm attracted to him? Why am I trying so badly to convince myself that it is true when I know it makes me feel like a piece of shit and that I would never act on them. I'm trying to calm myself by saying that this will pass but I don't believe me at all. Me and my boyfriend tried to have sex some days ago but images of my father kept popping up, I tried to push them away but in the end I felt so fucking ashamed and sick. I tried to masturbate and again my mind went there, I kept on refocusing it but in the end I still felt like I was purposely thinking these thoughts. I've never had anything like that happen before and I'm afraid to hear what my therapist has to say.

I‚Äôm a F/25 i‚Äôve been diagnosed with Pure O OCD with changing themes, GAD , DPDR ( Depersonalization/ Derealization).

As of late my OCD theme has been about the fear of developing Schizophrenia and or Psychosis‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs slowly changed to the fear of hearing sounds and or hallucinating.. Anyways here we are now.

there have been times when i‚Äôm reading something and a random phrase comes into my head that almost sounds like someone else. It‚Äôs weird because it interrupts what i‚Äôm reading in a soft form where it‚Äôs not demanding or telling me to do anything it just says something like ‚Äú no that was the wrong thing ‚Äú or ‚Äú stop ‚Äú or just random words ‚Ä¶this happens for example when i was reading about something on facebook about a friend who had a baby.. essentially the thoughts don‚Äôt correlate to whatever i‚Äôm reading‚Ä¶ 
i‚Äôve asked my therapist and he‚Äôs told me that that intrusive thoughts come in all shapes and sizes but because i have DPDR which is a disassociative disorder i already feel detached so things and sounds sound weird‚Ä¶ 
anyways i was wondering can intrusive thoughts sound like this? has anyone every experienced them this way? I‚Äôve been fixating on my thought, things i think about , i have mild confusion about things so that does help but i‚Äôm scared that this is early signs for schizophrenia or psychosis, i know u don‚Äôt have to necessarily have schizophrenia in order to have psychotic feature aka ( Delusions, Hallucinations, etc..) 

However a few months ago i was sure i never heard voices i could say it very confidently now my thoughts feel so loud i doubt it and think what if i have.. and i‚Äôm not explaining this well enough and everyone‚Äôs missing the signs.. 

OCD has really impacted me horrible i was recently diagnosed with it and im currently doing CBT for it but i was wondering about these type of intrusive thoughts.. sometimes when i try to recreate the thought i heard in the females voice i can really focus on it and recreate it in my head it‚Äôs just weird that it pops up out of no where when reading‚Ä¶ 


i‚Äôve read a few articles saying intrusive thoughts HAVE to be in your own voice and no one else‚Äôs but i‚Äôm confused because i know for a fact i‚Äôve always had inner monologue with different voices and tones in my head that i was in control of the only difference with these is that i don‚Äôt really control them hence the intrusion.

I have tried to see a therapist about this issue, before and recently, and oddly feel blown off. They would rather focus on ways to relieve my depression and an anxiety so far, and I have yet to find a trauma-therapy specialist accessible. I feel extremely creepy.

I have lost a baby before due to preterm labor, and had a very traumatic second trimester death. My best friends husband fell off a high rise in 2019, and then she followed him in 2020. I had to take my mom off of life support after she couldn't recover from a bad stroke she suffered at home alone last year.

 So now I can't stop thinking about what would happen if anyone died. Like how would they feel in certain scenarios, would I be able to save them, how my life or my children or their loved ones wud be affected.

 I do this with people I really don't care for, and kind of just run through the potential benefits like if my crappy landlord died, what would happen to the tenants, if my spouses high conflict ex died, how would that affect my stepkid? I have no desire to hurt anyone, but it does play often in detail and I would it not to.

 The worse one is, it happens with my loved ones too. More often, in fact. Like not just oh, what would our lives be like if spouse died but What steps would I take financially, what would be the final thought in their head, what would most likely kill them and how much pain and fear would they experience?

I was walking my dog in our neighborhood, and we almost got attacked by a dog. To set the scene: I live in a gated apartment complex in a bad part of town. The complex is on a side road, where on the other side of the road further down the way is a walkway that is between the aforementioned road and private properties, and between the walkway and the road is a row of skinny trees and other foliage that make it difficult to see past.

So if I'm standing on my side and looking towards the street, I see the curb, a wall of trees, a walkway, and chainlink fences with tarps draped over them as to obscure people looking into the yard; in that order

I've walked my dog on my side of this road before. It's not particularly dangerous during the day. There are some dogs who bark from the hidden backyards, but I don't think anything of it.

I never thought about those dogs until, yesterday afternoon, one appeared before me from the shroud

It was a mutt, brown in color. It's eyes were black. It was looking at me, I was looking at it. My fight or flight reflex triggered, and I chose fight. I was ready, bending my knees and arms extended in front. I was ready to yell at the dog, but not to scare it. I was prepared to embolster myself like some misplaced Viking or kenshi that was readying themselves for a fight. I was fully intent that this would be a fight, and there would be no other option

I thought I was ready to defend myself and my sweet pet, bless her. So why am I not dog meat right now?

My wife came by with the car before the dog had time to lunge at me. I let my dog in first (she loves the car, this was no big ask) and I followed. The dog was turning around the car like a rodeo cowboy turns around a barrel, but we made it and only because my wife has impeccable timing

I keep replaying that in my head. I drove past where it happened. I looked up what to do in that situation for the future, and I literally checked all boxes of what *not* to do to de-escalate things

I keep thinking about how much harm could have befallen me and what could have happened to my dog had things played out the way things were playing out.

Dont get me wrong, i dont have any problems with atheist people, for instance, half my friends are atheist and we really dont bother each others beliefs, but the thing is, this disturbed me. It didnt really changed my belief in some kind of God, but the fear that those thoughts were the truth were haunting me, it was just the beggining. 2018, my intrusive thoughts turned very nihilistic. I like philosophy, i am not going to lie, but i feel the difference when i am reflecting upon it and when it is a intrusive thought. If i was analysing nihilism, i would be able to decide when i am thinking about it, and it wouldnt disturb me, when i had a intrusive thought about nihilism, there is just anxiety related to it, an d every logic and rational thinking is throught out of the window. In 2020, i started to have intrusive thoughts about free will, then about reality, then about our size compared to the size of the universe, and so on. I started to have intrusive thoughts about my hobbies too. When i was reading, or writing, or watching a movie, the intrusive thoughts would start to question if i really liked what i was doing, it was very annoying. most recently, i had intrusive thoughts related to a book that i read. In one part of the book, the author classifies hobbies and other activities not considered essentials were harmful to us, bacause in the early days, humans were adapted to execute acctivities necessary to their survival. Even tho i dont agree with that, and i have plenty of rational arguments against the author, it still here, as a intrusive thought. My intrusive thoughts are afraid that he is right and all my hobbies will not fullfill me any happiness. I am tired of it all, how can i stop my intrusive thoughts?

We are researchers from the Clinical Psychology Department at The University of Oxford, and we are interested in learning more about the link between difficult interpersonal memories and emotional responses.

We are interested in hearing from people who identify as having obsessional and compulsive problems, and those without current experiences of mental health difficulties.¬†

We are hoping to develop a deeper understanding of factors that may contribute to distress in this area, with the hope of tailoring and improving treatments for these individuals.

We are looking for volunteers aged 18 years and over. Participating in the research will take approximately 1 hour, and will involve a short telephone discussion, an experimental task via video, and completion of some questionnaires.

I am not a violent or negative person, and I actually have a consistent fear of being a bad person. Basically, I've recently been struggling with intrusive thoughts whenever I encounter something negative. So basically, if I were to watch a documentary about a serial killer or like the tv show ""You"", there's always a voice in my head basically constantly saying ""would you ever do this? would you ever hurt someone? would you be capable of there horrible things?"", and I do know that these thoughts come from a fear of being a bad person or doing bad things, but I can't seem to silence them. I've done some research and have ready many things about saying that if you constantly try to silence this voice, it becomes louder and stronger, for example like the story about the white wolf and the black wolf. I'm aware intrusive thoughts are normal for pretty much everyone, but it has come to a point where it has interrupted my day to day life. Every time I watch a show about bad people, or I read a story or watch a documentary about people doing horrible things basically, the ""voice"" in my head keeps asking if I would ever do these things, or even start to encourage me to such things. I'm very clear that these are just intrusive thoughts and not urges, but I have a constant fear that if they remain in my head too long that they'll start to actually drive me insane. Recently they've calmed down a bit, but they're still there. I just want to go back to thinking normally and positively lol. Theres also a person in my life that has done something really horrible to me when I was just a little kid, but they were considered a ""good person"" to everyone else, which I think sparked this fear of being a bad person or doing bad things.

I've always had trouble calming my mind down, even on my ADD medication. It helps, but only so far. If I don't take my medication, they're almost unbearable. But, I'm working on it. 

Not to get too into the specifics, I'm just going through a rough time and can't get the intrusive thoughts to go away. I'm still able to distinguish how I'm making up worst case scenarios and stories for every tiny detail and knowing I'm doing it. That helps, but doesn't stop them. My therapist also recommended some Self Loving Kindness meditation and start exercising again, which has been a tremendous help! The medication has helped me gain the tools to bring myself back to the moment when my mind becomes exhausted. 

As the day goes on, things get a little easier (still can't stop them completely), but the mornings have been as awful as when these problems arose. Well, a little better. Last week was the first time, in my life, that I considered hurting myself, but was able to get ahold of my therapist. I tried the suicide hotline, but after being on hold I just hung up. Again, I'm not close to that dark feeling, but I felt it might be informative. 

Anyone have any other tips or coping skills for the morning? I haven't tried working out in the mornings because i have 2 toddlers who are *very* early risers.

They started out as the typical, similar-to-ocd thoughts like ‚Äúoh if you do this ..... will happen to ....‚Äù or ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do this .... will happen‚Äù I‚Äôd blink 10 times every night before I went to sleep otherwise I‚Äôd go blind. This eventually turned into 100 times and if I missed a number I‚Äôd restart. (I still don‚Äôt think my eyes have even recovered from that)

Around August-September 2021 I finally searched it up and found out they were intrusive thoughts and got advice online ,which, said to just ignore them. This actually really helped and every now and then I still have them but I don‚Äôt take part nearly as much as I used to. BUT I recently discovered that I say the shit I‚Äôm thinking out loud. (This was after my old intrusive thoughts died down) I was just doing my work and the guy I sat next to told me to shut up. So, after that I‚Äôd always be so scared of saying what I‚Äôm thinking out loud. 

But in January my intrusive thoughts came back but in a different form. Instead of telling me what to do they‚Äôd be so disturbing and uncomfortable. It‚Äôs like my mind knows I‚Äôm stressed about people judging me for ‚Äòtalking to myself‚Äô so it made me say/think the worst thing possible to just humiliate me and hurt others. And recently these thoughts have been racist and I can‚Äôt stand it. People give me weird looks and talk about me ,which, is completely understandable (if I heard someone say the N word I‚Äôd bully the shit out of them too) my best friend knows about my thoughts (I‚Äôm not even sure if she even believes me or if she just thinks I‚Äôm just making shit up for attention) but I decided I‚Äôd rather her hear the racist thoughts from me than my classmates and told her about them this morning. She seemed to understand at first but she‚Äôs been acting weird since then. I‚Äôm scared to loose her as a friend cause she‚Äôs legit one of the nicest people I‚Äôve ever met. 

I‚Äôve started to have suicidal thoughts and honestly think I‚Äôd be better off dead sometimes than constantly hurting people unwillingly.

They view me as the person that I want to be(social, funny, hot as fuck) but I'm not. People who have left my life .. girlfriends and friends who haven't seen me in more than a year or two will be having a drink with me on this delusional world and my mind actually constructs conversations between myself and these people and it goes so deep in, my body laughs or cries or feels mentally euphoric or sad, depending on what and who I'm thinking about. This means happy and sad chemicals are being released into my brain for thinking about unreal situations. 
Everybody has cute little scenarios in their heads with their crush or friends but i sometimes even have these scenarios where i lose my dad or mom or brother...or even some of my closest friends and how I'll have the attention on me at their funeral and how I'll act and behave
Im afraid feeling good out of these scenarios will over a period of time sort of pave this path in my brain that only gives me happiness in these unrealistic situations whereas i get nothing off of the real world. I have irregular sleep cycles. I don't take care of my physical or mental health. I don't know how to socially interact with people...I'm not a loner i have friends but sometimes I just don't know how to talk to people and i seem boring. I made a few mistakes in my life and I'm only 20. after lockdown when i travelled to another state my girlfriend/bestfriend/complicated told me she never wants to talk to me ever again and she cut me out of her life and my bestfriends took her side.

I regarded them closer than my family and i still think about them every day in my head but it's sad because ik they don't think about me. I miss them. (Complicated toxic relationship tho) 
Im lazy and extremely underweight. I used to lie a lot for no reason but I'm trying to do better. I know i am.
So yeah. This is just a sliver into what i feel and think...i just wanted to let it out cause honestly I don't even know why I feel numb. I masturbate a lot and can't concentrate for shit. Im kinda above average looking but after my last relationship...which ended around September2021 i haven't really engaged myself into that whole ""thing"". I've been with three girls within that period but it felt insignificant. 
I don't think i will live past 25. Or past the dates both my parents die. I don't feel motivated. I don't like myself. And I'm physically fucked. I have friends but no souls i connect with so I've been keeping this all in for a while and just wanted to get it out.

Arduous theoretical readings may be interesting but they don‚Äôt bring you one inch closer to that experience. Nor do yoga classes and meditation retreats, although tranquility of mind helps, of course.\n\nWe are immersed in a world stretched in space and time which, as Emmanuel Kant had taught Schopenhauer, are the product of our perception. They don‚Äôt exist out there, not as we perceive them. In whatever you see and touch,  the thing itself, *das Ding an Sich*, is beyond your grasp. And science since then has only confirmed: particles or planets do not care for *our* space and time. Examples: subatomic particles may ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù each other from one side of the universe to the other, something Einstein found quite ‚Äúspooky‚Äù when it was discovered. The shortest line between two cosmic points may be a curve or a zigzag. The chemical structure of  sugar is not sugary, it‚Äôs made of molecules ‚Ä¶ etc. Looking outside,  especially without a microscope or a telescope, one can only fall prey  to the Veil of Maya whose name Schopenhauer took from early Indian  thinking, and which he described as the ‚Äúveil of deception that blinds  the eye and makes us behold a dream; like the sunshine on the sand one  takes to be water; the stray piece of rope one perceives as a snake.‚Äù\n\nThere is no way for us to break beyond the ‚Äúphysics‚Äù and reach the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù by looking outside; one has to look inside and rely on the inner sensation.  One has to fall into the vertical of oneself, so to speak. But here starts the difficulty because as soon as I close his *The World as Will and Representation* and use my inner sensations, what do I see? Well, try it yourself.  Nothing at first. Night. But stay there, be patient. My inner world is amorphous, without clear dimensions, time or space, without markers or possible orientation, but it is not empty. Far from it. It is populated by all kinds of thoughts, traces of the outside, words, memories, lots of trivial concerns and worries. A litany of obsessions roams my mind.  And also, desires, intentions, and impulsions, which are not all fantasies since they make me move my fingers, my arms. Now I can experience my body twice: as an object among other objects in time and space, and inside as a timeless and spaceless psyche that I call self to simplify matters. I can return to the same inner life day after day and witness the same aimless activity. And I can also assume that all the other bodies, and not only human bodies‚Äîmy dog, my cat‚Äîmust have the same ability to dive into *themselves*. The velleity felt inside to move their legs and twist their head.\n\nNow,  without forgetting Schopenhauer, but using him to think for myself  (which is what he did to the philosophers he discarded or retained piecemeal in order to become a thinker who did not mimic or merely comment), I personally find a worry that does not express itself, does not appear distinctly at all, yet overflows all the others‚Äîthe intimation of my death, mine, one that awaits me and nobody else. The point may be banal: there is no sharing this death unless I want to bring down the house. It concerns only me, but I am also sure that their death concerns to some degree everybody else (cats and dogs included).  It‚Äôs up to me to imagine this endgame sweet, a peaceful rest, a beach after the storm, deserved silence after all the obsessions have detached from me like so many rags. The worry of all worries, fear squared, is this anguish without object, without reason, metaphysical anxiety,  apprehension of the bottomless, which one usually fills up with a  pell-mell of beliefs tied up in a hurry (although the scaffolding may have lasted centuries), surely not to fall into it.\n\nAt once  Paradise and Hell, I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, but I know it‚Äôs there.  My coming death is like a particle flipping on itself; I can‚Äôt locate its movement, but I feel it all around scratching my inner realm at the speed of light. Is that all we can do with this dive inside? No, that  was only the first step. Schopenhauer had a second thought, forward this one, practical and transformative. A momentous step that is not without consequence for those who seek to withdraw from illusions, and hold back on the slope of worries and obligations. By practicing this stepping back assiduously, one day one will manage to glimpse the extinction of the Will as such, according to Schopenhauer. One will undermine *the want* which is the essence of everything (although not consciously in the case of trees and mountains) and of every being  (you, me, your cat, your dog) since everyone wants to be what they are  (they only suffer, kill others or themselves because they think they can‚Äôt). We all strive for more of who or what we are. Everything is subject to that aimless blind striving that has ultimately no goal and no other motivation than to strive some more.\n\nOne may eventually succeed to no longer *want*.  No more concerns and hassle. Nirvana! This second step is more difficult to practice than sitting in lotus and I must admit that I am still considering basic anxieties. I know in my every day this pointless fear which, as it often turns out later, defended me against the worst.  I recognize in me the distress signals that on the high seas save lives. On the outside, my death is foreseeable in my arteries, they can push it back medically, precipitate it, but it is not observable in the  moment, which lasts a lifetime when I consider giving up altogether.  When I am not content to imagine cessation, rehash or rehearse the circumstances. I am not speaking here of suicide. I speak of this second death which is like a restless sleep agitated by ultimate questions;  this *little-death* that was once said to accompany sexual pleasure. The steps backward and then sideways that I evoke here can keep company to a life of pleasure as much as pain (not too much,  however). The feeling of my approaching death deepens a life of comfort as much as one of need‚Äîrelative, too much deprivation risks destroying my body and I have to live this approaching death.\n\nThis is where I  humbly separate myself from the philosopher, still too entangled in religion, which he seeks in India. It‚Äôs not an ascetic discipline I am looking for. Not a moral renunciation, nor a militant leap ahead of myself to change the world. No counterproductive revolution. No question for me of extinguishing the will to live after having torn the Veil of  Maya and frequented the anguish of death sent in a special courier to me. It‚Äôs a question of holding it in respect and of exploiting *her* arrival,  of using her as a sort of capital, an inexhaustible resource, a means of seeing things more clearly; for instance, of no longer listening to the chorus of high-pitched voices singing the refrain of brighter or worse tomorrows. My approaching death has no tomorrow; she only has a  now. It will always take place soon now. As long as I live, this hollow in my stomach that never leaves, I can place my bets on it, and besides wanting nothing more, I may no longer simply want. Whenever I desire  something henceforth, a shadow will accompany my gesture, a whole metaphysics.

The chemical structure of  sugar is not sugary, it‚Äôs made of molecules ‚Ä¶ etc. Looking outside,  especially without a microscope or a telescope, one can only fall prey  to the Veil of Maya whose name Schopenhauer took from early Indian  thinking, and which he described as the ‚Äúveil of deception that blinds  the eye and makes us behold a dream; like the sunshine on the sand one  takes to be water; the stray piece of rope one perceives as a snake.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no way for us to break beyond the ‚Äúphysics‚Äù and reach the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù by looking outside; one has to look inside and rely on the inner sensation.  One has to fall into the vertical of oneself, so to speak. But here starts the difficulty because as soon as I close his &lt;em&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/em&gt; and use my inner sensations, what do I see? Well, try it yourself.  Nothing at first. Night. But stay there, be patient. My inner world is amorphous, without clear dimensions, time or space, without markers or possible orientation, but it is not empty. Far from it. It is populated by all kinds of thoughts, traces of the outside, words, memories, lots of trivial concerns and worries. A litany of obsessions roams my mind.  And also, desires, intentions, and impulsions, which are not all fantasies since they make me move my fingers, my arms. Now I can experience my body twice: as an object among other objects in time and space, and inside as a timeless and spaceless psyche that I call self to simplify matters. I can return to the same inner life day after day and witness the same aimless activity. And I can also assume that all the other bodies, and not only human bodies‚Äîmy dog, my cat‚Äîmust have the same ability to dive into &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;. The velleity felt inside to move their legs and twist their head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now,  without forgetting Schopenhauer, but using him to think for myself  (which is what he did to the philosophers he discarded or retained piecemeal in order to become a thinker who did not mimic or merely comment), I personally find a worry that does not express itself, does not appear distinctly at all, yet overflows all the others‚Äîthe intimation of my death, mine, one that awaits me and nobody else. The point may be banal: there is no sharing this death unless I want to bring down the house. It concerns only me, but I am also sure that their death concerns to some degree everybody else (cats and dogs included).  It‚Äôs up to me to imagine this endgame sweet, a peaceful rest, a beach after the storm, deserved silence after all the obsessions have detached from me like so many rags. The worry of all worries, fear squared, is this anguish without object, without reason, metaphysical anxiety,  apprehension of the bottomless, which one usually fills up with a  pell-mell of beliefs tied up in a hurry (although the scaffolding may have lasted centuries), surely not to fall into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At once  Paradise and Hell, I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, but I know it‚Äôs there.  My coming death is like a particle flipping on itself; I can‚Äôt locate its movement, but I feel it all around scratching my inner realm at the speed of light. Is that all we can do with this dive inside? No, that  was only the first step. Schopenhauer had a second thought, forward this one, practical and transformative. A momentous step that is not without consequence for those who seek to withdraw from illusions, and hold back on the slope of worries and obligations. By practicing this stepping back assiduously, one day one will manage to glimpse the extinction of the Will as such, according to Schopenhauer. One will undermine &lt;em&gt;the want&lt;/em&gt; which is the essence of everything (although not consciously in the case of trees and mountains) and of every being  (you, me, your cat, your dog) since everyone wants to be what they are  (they only suffer, kill others or themselves because they think they can‚Äôt). We all strive for more of who or what we are. Everything is subject to that aimless blind striving that has ultimately no goal and no other motivation than to strive some more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One may eventually succeed to no longer &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;.  No more concerns and hassle. Nirvana! This second step is more difficult to practice than sitting in lotus and I must admit that I am still considering basic anxieties. I know in my every day this pointless fear which, as it often turns out later, defended me against the worst.  I recognize in me the distress signals that on the high seas save lives. On the outside, my death is foreseeable in my arteries, they can push it back medically, precipitate it, but it is not observable in the  moment, which lasts a lifetime when I consider giving up altogether.  When I am not content to imagine cessation, rehash or rehearse the circumstances. I am not speaking here of suicide. I speak of this second death which is like a restless sleep agitated by ultimate questions;  this &lt;em&gt;little-death&lt;/em&gt; that was once said to accompany sexual pleasure. The steps backward and then sideways that I evoke here can keep company to a life of pleasure as much as pain (not too much,  however). The feeling of my approaching death deepens a life of comfort as much as one of need‚Äîrelative, too much deprivation risks destroying my body and I have to live this approaching death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where I  humbly separate myself from the philosopher, still too entangled in religion, which he seeks in India. It‚Äôs not an ascetic discipline I am looking for. Not a moral renunciation, nor a militant leap ahead of myself to change the world. No counterproductive revolution. No question for me of extinguishing the will to live after having torn the Veil of  Maya and frequented the anguish of death sent in a special courier to me. It‚Äôs a question of holding it in respect and of exploiting &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; arrival,  of using her as a sort of capital, an inexhaustible resource, a means of seeing things more clearly; for instance, of no longer listening to the chorus of high-pitched voices singing the refrain of brighter or worse tomorrows. My approaching death has no tomorrow; she only has a  now. It will always take place soon now. As long as I live, this hollow in my stomach that never leaves, I can place my bets on it, and besides wanting nothing more, I may no longer simply want. Whenever I desire  something henceforth, a shadow will accompany my gesture, a whole metaphysics. It‚Äôs in my power.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'DeepThoughts', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qwm7', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/DeepThoughts', 'subreddit_subscribers': 65891, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'My Portable Two-Steps Schopenhauer', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 1, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/tsmnjk/my_portable_twosteps_schopenhauer/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",/r/DeepThoughts/comments/tsmnjk/my_portable_twosteps_schopenhauer/,,,

i cant stop thinking about my mom getting in a car crash and dying. i wish it stopped there. i can see and FEEL the look on her face and here her voice say ‚Äúfuck‚Äù right before impact and the way her face will get red and she panics and her heart drops as she crashes and her body get absolutely shredded and mutilated across the road. chunks of guts in the road and in what‚Äôs left of the car and i have anxiety all day bc the wifi at school doesn‚Äôt work so i can‚Äôt check her location so i‚Äôm always expecting her to not be there when i get home and anytime the teacher‚Äôs phone ring i get a sick feeling it for me to get signed out bc my mom just died. it‚Äôs gotten to the point where anything that has to do with car crashes is taken as a ‚Äúsign‚Äù from the universe to me that it will happen soon and if i don‚Äôt do something such as take my socks off at night that means there‚Äôs a higher chance my mom will crash

they get so much worse or more gruesome but this one is the most likely to happen so it actually gives me anxiety everyday not knowing if my mom will make it home that day

Like it totally freaking sucks. For instance I‚Äôll share this one with you. About 1 year ago my automobile was vandalized by this racist woman in my local area. I did what I guess the normal person would do and called the police. Cops showed up. Took a look at the slashed tires and made a report. I told the officer that I wanted to press charges and he asked me if I ever dated her. I proceeded to tell him that I did not. He then stated I couldn‚Äôt do it unless I was in a relationship with her.

I threw many strange and potentially offensive objects, most frequently rubber gloves filled with water, tied to form the gesture of a middle finger. Out of pure mischievousness and frustration, along with a dislike for the few Trump supporters in my neighborhood (very unpopular in the neighborhood and city), I began to expand this throwing hobby to other backyards and the street.

Feel free to ask any questions for clarity if you don't understand something I've written about**

This intrusive thought is getting so bad that it's making me feel as though as If 'm having second thoughts with my relationship with my girl. It even makes me feel as though as if I am being spiritually followed or haunted by this person that I've been obsessing over; almost as if they had done something physically wrong to me in person in the past. 

Nothing physical ever happened and I know for sure because I only talked to them a couple of times through FB messages a long time ago and never made contact in person because I was too cowardly. 

**Background**: The person that I'm obsessing over (lets call them AO) is still alive based on what I've seen on FB just pointing that out because I don't want the above to confuse anyone. The person from my past told me , ""I hate girls that can't respect themselves.""

Also, Recently I did watch the Netflix documentary called, ""the Tinder Swindler"" and it made me upset so much, so I'm not sure if watching that and thinking of what the past person said gave me these intrusive thoughts or not.

**Current Intrusiveness**: During the past few weeks, I've been having dreams of me having different conversations in different settings and all of these conversations ended up with me being in vulnerable and confused situations. One of them was about me being with AO in a relationship and he was distant toward me and I was trying to talk to them, but I couldn't hear anything coming from them. The next one was about me working as a hostess or waitress and they were sitting in some bar and I walked up to them to greet them and take an order and they said something about not seeing me for a long time and asking what I'm doing here and I was feeling uncomfortable like I wanted to run away or exposed in some way, so in the dream I made small talk, took his order and walked quickly away... then All I remember was me kneeling on the side of the wall outside the back of the place and feeling sad and possibly crying and then they comes up behind and leans down to comfort me and asks ""What's wrong?"" and told me, ""Everything's gonna be okay, I'll still take care of you and our baby."" Then I turned toward them and started crying as I told them that It's not that simple because I loved them, but I'm married to my girl and everything's too late now. The dreams ended here.

Although I haven't had any more dreams about them anymore, I still do from time to time every day have these strong feelings like someone (they as in AO) is always around me, watching me, waiting for me. Its getting so bad to the point where its making me feel like I'm cheating on my spouse, but how can that be? I feel like it's making me doubt my orientation all together and I hate the feeling because I've learned to accept myself for who I am years ago.",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,89212,public,self,From the Past...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/toh2zs/from_the_past/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

It all changed a couple of days ago when I was casually scrolling through tiktok my own inner monologue suddenly said I'm a pedo.this rly threw me as previously it was like someone was saying it to me(it's now been going between 1st and 3rd person)on the first day I manged to cope even tho I actively started to plan.and then yesterday I had a better day after going back to videos I found helpful before when I was like this then suddenly it hit like a ton of bricks and I started spiralling again.atm I can't see anything related to kids without suddenly thinking out if nowhere somthing disturbing (some examples are ""you'd r**e her"" ""go train as a pediatric nurse so you can r**e kids"" ""you'd use that to lure kids"" all of these disturbing me deeply and things I'd never dream of doing).it's become intolerable and I've been researching how to ""you know what ""pain free.
The thing is now I'm not even sure if it's just intrusive thoughts or if I am actually a pedo.even though kids don't arouse me ( I'm 99.9 precent sure of this but recently I'm not so sure as I keep on getting the feeling of being turned on even tho I don't get off to kids and it repulses me but my body does have a habit of getting turned on when stressed so it might be it).part of the reason it's so distressing is I used to love kids and kids loved me.i did a childcare gcse and was amazing at it (I got an a 3 marks of an a*),I did mu work experince at an additional needs school and signed up to be a leader at my local rainbows group ( a dream from when I was a rainbow).I even wanted kids even tho I wouldn't have had them due to my mood disoder.the sad thing is I was actually thinking about having kids in my future when the first set of thoughts happened.
I geuss I'm just looking for advice about whether or not I'm a pedo or if it's intrusive thoughts and for slightly selfish reasons reassurance that I'm not a terrible person.this has been done on a throw away cuz I need advice but don't want it to get traced to me for obvious reasons.if this is too graphic pls say and I'll edit it.tbh I may delete this out of shame tmrrw

""A father\'s tyranny in all its glory,"" she laughed with a grimace. Indeed, few canonical authors seem to better personify the misdeeds of patriarchy.\n\nAt first sight, *Paradise Lost* is about an all-powerful but absent God, who weaves in his empty eternity a diabolical trap into which Adam and Eve‚Äî the apple of His eye, nonetheless, the jewel of His Creation‚Äî can only fall. The Original Sin consists in biting into a fruit such as one finds at the grocer around the corner, nothing more; but this misdemeanor He will make them pay not only until the end of their days but until the end of the days of their offspring and in the centuries to come. It would be awful if it weren\'t ridiculous. One wonders how people as subtle as John Milton could believe and peddle such nonsense. However, when it comes to a seventeenth-century author the question of belief is too complex for this short meditation. Let us say that in the story of the Fall, Milton had found a perfect ‚Äúargument‚Äù (his word) for a vast Christian epic involving God, His Son, various Angels, without forgetting the most intelligent of them all, the fallen archangel Satan, and the frailty of the first human beings, Adam and Eve. Here is roughly sketched the canvas of a twelve-book poem we would prefer to leave on the shelf if we did not have to take an exam. And yet it is in *Paradise Lost* that I bumped into the most extraordinary passage and, on the part of a female character, the words and the gesture that I would qualify as the most radical ever described in a work of fiction if I weren\'t afraid of lapsing into bombast myself.\n\nIf you allow, before climbing this Everest of literature and getting to the free fall of the 9th book where Eve refuses life in her and outside her, and says ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ not for me‚Äù to His Creation altogether‚Äîwe must prepare ourselves in the valley. According to Milton, to complete his plan, God has put his Angels to sleep. Usually vigilant, they have let Satan sneak inside the enclosure of purity and he crawls to the bed where Adam and Eve are fast asleep. God withdraws behind his layer of clouds and washes his hands of the outcome, letting the ‚Äúten thousand years‚Äù of evil knowledge condensed in Satan roam free in Paradise. Milton‚Äôs version fits nicely with the notion that God must let Eve free to choose between good and evil. 1600 years of Christianity before Milton and centuries of Judaism before that justified the presence of evil in Paradise the same way: freedom is challenging. Except that Milton complicates the matter, he spices up the Biblical story. His God exposes Eve to having her ear occupied in her sleep! Transformed into a toad, Satan climbs to the first woman‚Äôs face and sneaks his slimy tongue into her ear to puff her up with pride: He uses ‚Äúhis wiles, to reach/ The organ of her fancy, and with them forge/ Illusions as he list, phantasm, and dreams.‚Äù The first woman is the perfect victim of a mind-rape, exposed unconsciously to the verbal assaults of a beast that whispers inside her head how good the apple is, and what a heroic woman she will be, honored until the end of time for having freed the humanity still in her womb from the yoke of ignorance.\n\nThe next day, during her solitary walk, she will bite into ‚Äúthe fruit‚Äù with the best of intentions. And then, boosted by the placebo effect of this fruit, there is this wild scene where Adam and Eve indulge in an orgy of the senses as graphically pictured as iambic pentameters ever could. Milton was not a Puritan and he leaves little to the imagination. Note that Adam and Eve are the most beautiful specimens of our species and their enjoyment is not yet watered down by the restrictions of civilization. They are ‚Äúdrugged‚Äù (the word is in Milton) by the phony virtues of the apple, nudged into arrogance by the trespassing of God‚Äôs prohibition with apparent immunity, all this under the frightened gaze of the Angels.\n\nUntil, all groggy and hanged-over, they wake up late in the afternoon and find out how changed their condition is‚Äîthe entire Creation actually. They feel ashamed of their nakedness and cover the organs they have abused. We turn the page and here we are before this passage which, I still believe to this day has not been appreciated at its true value. Me the non-specialist, the neophyte, the foreigner, I allow myself to think that four centuries of erudition and specialization have underestimated a moment, an attitude, an essential facet of the central character of Eve. A page of *Paradise Lost* has not been read. Eve is a wonderful woman in John Milton. She is a great lady and a mind worthy of the British aristocracy at the time. She is young, exquisitely formed, pure, and needless to say, intelligent and informed, but naive as all beautiful souls are. And yet in the passage, we are now reading she is disgusted by the fact of having been seduced by a toad at night and by a snake by day. Milton\'s Eve is so disillusioned that she literally sends to Hell everything, starting with her own life, which is the life of us all.\n\nLet us seek Death, or he not found,\n\nSupply With our own hands his office on ourselves;\n\nWhy stand we any longer shivering under fears;\n\nThat show no end but Death, and have the power,\n\nOf \u200b\u200bmany ways to die the shortest choosing,\n\nDestruction with destruction to destroy.\n\n‚ÄúDestruction with destruction to destroy...‚Äù So prescient is this Eve. It\'s as though she has read about Hegel\'s negation of the negation, otherwise called infinite negativity. The sin of which we carry the blemish, let‚Äôs get rid of it, let\'s cancel it by annihilating ourselves. Let us search in the kitchen of Paradise for a knife with which to attack the monster, and let us wait no longer for one or other of its morbid manifestations to prowl into the precincts of so-called purity and traumatize us. Of course, these magnificent verses could not have found their way to the mouth of this woman almost naked like an animal, nor ourselves stood a chance to read them if she had taken *the shortest way*, this side road which was not foreseen in God‚Äôs software. If Eve had run towards *the Maw of Hell* and opened Death‚Äôs mouth, looked inside, nothingness would have swallowed up all Creation, her progeny, humanity *ab ovo*.\n\nBut that\'s where I would like to add: Maybe it\'s not about running into it, it‚Äôs enough to face it, look it in the face, not fear this many-headed mouth of Hell. Eve‚Äôs attitude is worthy of the most tragic among the Greek characters when they refuse their destiny and reject the unavoidable. For Milton, this represented an impossible moment, unsustainable. The life of the species must take place, Cain and Abel must hate each other, little Milton must be born one day, men and women must swarm on earth and tear each other apart, his story must continue until God decides at the end of time to save some of them through his only Son, who will be martyred and crucified few thousand years earlier to that effect. We are in the 17th century when we read *Paradise Lost*, and yet Eve‚Äôs challenge is out of time, still ahead of us and just as extreme: I don\'t want any more of it, she says, if it is so badly put together, Your Creation, thank you very much, take it back! But, of course, ultimately Eve is a woman, and in Milton\'s day, a woman who loves her man submits to that man.\n\nAnother recap could go: she refuses. She does not want her children and her children\'s children to be born in sin and live the rest of their lives, sadly eternal after death, damned in Hell. Adam shows her that she is wrong and that it is better to respond to what is expected of them in this first life, accept the fault, and not seek a death that‚Äôs unavoidable and will come soon enough. Adam had to be right. The sequence of events will prove him right. Next page, exiled from Paradise, the first two humans will submit to a short life of work, to the pains of childbirth, to prohibitions... it was not possible otherwise.

Nobody laughed of course. They weren't even mad really. Everyone was just kind of confused. My friend asked why I did it and I had no answer. I immediately felt ashamed and embarrassed. It's one of those things where I'm sure in 20 years I'll lay awake at night cringing at my past self.

But first, I will ask you to please read this short foray through before getting indignant at these uncomfortable or, to use the philosopher‚Äôs word, untimely considerations.\n\nThe Master acts, he creates, he imposes his will, and shapes the world around him. The Slave does not act, he reacts and resents the reality in which he has not chosen to live. But the more the Slave resents what the Master does, the more he depends on him: 1) because the Slave creates nothing, and 2)  because he needs to feed his resentment. However, Nietzsche\'s analysis takes a curious turn, to not use again the word \'dialectics\' which  Nietzsche did not like. It is the Slave who ends up winning their fight by bringing morality into play. Slowly but surely, the Slave gets into the Master‚Äôs skin. He creeps into his thoughts and makes him feel guilty. This is a theme that feeds all of Nietzsche‚Äôs works, *Genealogy of Morals* in particular. A scholar and a specialist in Hellenistic languages,  Nietzsche thought that the Greek civilization destroyed itself, it lost its vaunted beauty and grandeur with the coming of Socrates, whom he despised viscerally. For him, Socrates was not only short and ugly, but he also talked about everything and especially the essential Greek values (courage, the search for truth, for justice‚Ä¶ etc) by splitting hair, by making everyone doubt around him and corrupting‚Äîunable as  Socrates was to seduce their bodies‚Äîthe spirit of Athens‚Äô youth. This theme fueled Nietzsche\'s antisemitism (and was used by the Nazis)  because for him the Jew is likewise short and ugly, a powerless being who compensates by a big head, someone steeped in morals who loves to discuss the most sacred customs and to put his fingers in the Master\'s eye.\n\nOne could say that the Master has no scruples when imposing his desire; the Slave is the one who was (and still is) afraid of death  (as explained more clearly by Hegel, whom Nietzsche hated and knew little about). The Slave will have taken fright in front of a  human-looking brute and suppressed his desire for power; waiting generation after generation for a tomorrow that would sing his praise, a  brighter future when he could finally enjoy his revenge in broad daylight.\n\nOf course, I simplify Nietzsche\'s analysis. As with any great thinker, what he disliked and diminished was also what he magnified and scrutinized. While going against the Slave/the Jew,  Nietzsche brought out of him the most fundamental quality, his humanity.  The Master acts and does not think about the consequences. He is like a  tiger, a wolf: a whimsical, prolific, and dangerous animal. The Slave thinks about these consequences, rarely good in his eyes, above all harmful. Stewing in his resentment, the Slave ruminates all his life on the Master‚Äôs crimes. He feeds on them and constructs elaborate reproaches, intellectual attacks which, over the centuries, develop into religious and philosophical systems that become constraining institutions. It was the Slave who first brought subjectivity and morality into the world.\n\nAnd since then, the Master/Slave struggle has not ceased. In fact, now that social ties, moral and institutional restraints, even the sense of national unity give way under their combined assaults, we see their strife reach a climax and burst onto screens all over the world. It is quite true that today\'s masters are as cruel as a pack of wolves, scavengers like vultures, cunning like digitally enhanced foxes, and as competent as seals or otters would be at steering the wheel of supersonic cars. They no longer have any vision, any other goal concerning the herd than to sit on top. The mass of slaves, meanwhile, continues to chomp at the bit... not without exploding sometimes, for instance on Twitter!\n\nIn conclusion, I  will let the reader decide whether the struggle, also seemingly eternal,  between Ukrainians and Russians, falls under Nietzsche‚Äôs considerations. I am not a specialist in Slavic studies, but I get the impression that it does not.

We are researchers from the Clinical Psychology Department at The University of Oxford, and we are interested in learning more about the link between difficult interpersonal memories and emotional responses.

We are interested in hearing from people who identify as having obsessional and compulsive problems, and those without current experiences of mental health difficulties.¬†

We are hoping to develop a deeper understanding of factors that may contribute to distress in this area, with the hope of tailoring and improving treatments for these individuals.

We are looking for volunteers aged 18 years and over. Participating in the research will take approximately 1 hour, and will involve a short telephone discussion, an experimental task via video, and completion of some questionnaires.

Me (25f) and my bf (26m) have been dating for about 6 months.
He has exes, I have exes. He has a sexual history, I have a sexual history. His is more extensive than mine, I may add.

I know it shouldn‚Äôt matter what each of us have done in the past. I know that everything that‚Äôs happened before us has lead us to meeting and being the people that we are. 

But for some reason I get these intrusive thoughts, this images of him being with someone else. It‚Äôs so frustrating. Like sometimes I get the thought in my head, and it doesn‚Äôt cause an emotional response but I get annoyed that the thought even comes. Then sometimes I feel a jealous emotion. From what I‚Äôve read I think I have some retroactive jealousy going on. 

I‚Äôm just curious if anyone else has experiences these types of thoughts, and what have you done to move on and focus on the now.

What things do you tell yourself to fully accept your partners past?

Thanks!

I'm 31 and this is not how I expected things to be...

2 years ago (you can see old posts from where I was freaking out if you are interested) I went into memories of when I touched a family member when I was about 13. She was 10 years younger than me... fully clothed, on her backside. 

Therapists, friends and an ex-partner told me it was nothing. Why make a big deal out of it? etc... I mean I still feel awful about it regardless of what it was as it was non-consensual and I just kind of did it. But that's another story.

Going into it all exploded thoughts of being a pedofile. It peaked within the first few months where I was rotating around suicidal thoughts all day. I also seemed to sexualize everything... I could feel orgasmic feelings in my body when thinking of family members, men, women, animals, trees, sounds etc. It was actually kind of like a super power (I'm not talking about fantasizing about others - I actually stopped watching porn and creating sexual fantasies a few months before this started). I didn't really take too much of it seriously and did kind of see how I was just creating a feeling in my body, regardless of what I saw or not. I mean imagine just sitting somewhere boring like a meeting and tuning into orgasmic feelings in your body with no content. Life was very interesting. 

But there was honestly no limit. I had no problem with any of that, but children just made me feel like complete scum. 

Here's an example of what would happen... I would walk down the street and see a woman with a child. I would feel fear and anxiety. Constantly analysing... do I find her attractive, do I find the child attractive etc? All with the groinal response I've read about, maybe images in my mind and/or thoughts. The same would happen with animals. My eyes would go to the genitals, and then sexual feelings, thoughts etc.

And always (no matter the content) my thoughts, images etc would always be pleasurable. I could and would always feel nice feelings in my body with any type of thought. The other day I looked at a photo of a serial killer (a fat ugly one...) and felt my genitals tingling. You see how confusing this is? It's as though there is this pull towards very dark, taboo and bad things. But in reality I have never and have no intention of hurting anyone or engaging in those things. It's possibly some kind of fear of those things existing in me... I'm not sure. 

A few times during masturbation, blurred images/thoughts (the ones that used to run through my mind a lot of the time about children) appeared and, although I was totally disgusted with myself, it actually felt really good. Some part of me says I actually like that, another part says it is relief from constant stress of those types of thoughts, another says it is something to do with taboo... related to this are the ideas of what can separate me from society... whatever is the worst and just not the exact societal norm.

My mind always goes to these. Not to offend anyone but I am speaking in terms of the vanilla civilian (lol). So I feel instability in my personality when there is talk about gay people, racists, transvestites, pedophiles, murderers, rapists etc... people who repress things and then discover them, or people who are living some kind of secret life as something bad, or just something that doesn't fit the person's idea of how they think they should be in the world. I think you get the idea. It's always the thought of 'that could be me... I could be that'.

Sometimes in a large group of people; if you were to say all of those examples one after the other, with gaps in between each... I bet that I would turn red and feel anxious at each one, then turn back to normal colour in the gaps lol. It's strange.

I've honestly been through psychological hell during these past 2 years with other crazy stuff happening on top of this that I won't go into, but I'm mentioning it because that 'stuff' is kind of over and now this has returned with more force.

I have another therapist now I'm working with. The problem for me is that this comes on really strong... then it goes away. I sometimes admit out loud 'I am a pedofile' etc and say all the thoughts on my mind. Then it goes away and the whole thing feels silly.

I've even totally broken this 'pattern' where the whole ID'ing myself as some kind of sexual pervert or abuser lost its power. It faded away along with the idea that there was something wrong with me. But I'm not there now. I'm deep in this pedo shit and honestly kind of have no idea how to get out. Is there some kind of attraction there? How the hell do I tell? What are my true orientations, and what is mentally created?

There is definitely a difference from when I see an attractive woman in the street, to a little girl but I really can't seem to shake this. I know it's impossible to tell from a single post online but could anyone share any thoughts? Is it possible that I could be repressing some kind of attraction to young girls? Am I just mentally ill from holding this for so long?

My inward &amp; outward orientation has become much more self-centered and hating throughout this time too. Not great. Working on that a lot but it seems I am very far from real emotions or human connection. It's like I am extraditing myself from life. Sometimes I do think about suicide. I don't see anything else for myself. How the hell could this have happened, and why?

Then distracted and wake up. It wasn't dream i just was about to sleep. It was between sleep and awakeness. Then i started stress over why i heard the woman's voice saying my intrusive thought number.

Then i stand up and checked time hoping it is not x time. But it was. And 20 minutes passed from the time i turned my phone off and now it was x time. I started feel strong anxiety, why it was exactly that time.

Then the other day in order to make myself calm i bet with my brain that now im gonna look at my phone if the last number of time ends with x number, that means what happened  last night is true and my intrusive thought come  will come real, if not that means it was just a coincidence. i checked time and it ended with x number. 
Days later i was just about to forget that incidence. My cousin came to us and i gave her a question which answer was with number. After gave her this question i regret because i felt she would say that number. She think about that question and said that number. She had 29 number option and she chosed to say my intrusive number.

Hi all, sorry if I'm doing this wrong, this is my first time using Reddit although I often end up here. Let me just start by saying I have severe anxiety, to the point where it's debilitating sometimes. Like sometimes when I have an out of the blue panic attack, I can't hear someone two feet away from me because my ears are ringing and I'm starting to black out (I've never felt like I'm dying).

In wondering if I may be suffering from more than GAD, I've recently stumbled across the term intrusive thoughts as well as thought broadcasting and the last few doctors I've gone to haven't been able to diagnose me with anything other than GAD and given me bullshit meds that don't work. 

Examples of what I deal with regularly:
‚Ä¢ fear that someone is going to harm me while out in public (getting robbed or stabbed, or a drive-by)
‚Ä¢ when working in an office and someone walks by, I feel like I might inappropriately grab them and take days to convince myself I didn't (mostly men)
‚Ä¢ worried during meetings in person and online I said something and not sure if I actually did or not (yelling out inappropriate things)
‚Ä¢ scared to hold eye contact because I don't want it to be viewed as sexual, looking at someone's lips by mistake can send me into a full blown panic attack (this mostly happens with men)
‚Ä¢ when I'm two floors up, I think I can hear people in my house visiting my boyfriend talking shit about me (yes they're actually there)
‚Ä¢ when I'm around someone who has the same interests as me and then someone who knows that person starts talking to them about said interests, I feel like I'm the one being talked about 
‚Ä¢ TMI but say for instance I masturbated on my lunch break (at home), I feel like everyone knows when I go back to work 
‚Ä¢ if I think uncomfortable thoughts, sometimes I think people know what I'm thinking even though I know that's not true
‚Ä¢ I have guilt about things I've done that no one knows about from a decade ago, yet when someone is joking or discussing related topics I feel like they're talking about me specifically and know
‚Ä¢ I get incredibly uncomfortable if I think someone thinks I'm attracted to them in the workplace, even though I don't
‚Ä¢ laughing too hard or being out of breath can make me go into a panic attack because I forget why I'm laughing sometimes which makes me start creating memories of things that didn't even happen
‚Ä¢ the week before my period I'm a nervous wreck and all these symptoms are 10 fold
‚Ä¢ I get stressed out if I have to do anything on a Sunday because it's the end of the weekend and I have to mentally prepare for the following week for atleast a full day (mentally)
‚Ä¢ most symptoms get worse the better I get to know someone - for instance, I quit my last job after a year of mostly being okay (work from home), then all of a sudden one day this guy I worked with (hardly interacted with him at all and a nice person) started sending me into full blown panic attacks. When he would speak during meetings, my whole body would go cold and I couldn't hear him, then my face starts blushing and I'm worried if other people notice and then I get anxiety that everyone knows I'm having a panic attack. And this happened EVERYTIME I interacted with him OR if someone else mentioned his name to me even if he wasn't a part of the convo. He NEVER DID ANYTHING to make me uncomfortable. During my days off, I would spend the majority of my days thinking about how NOT to think about this person and be bother by them. This happened about 3-4 months into my previous job as well. 

I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting but I've been dealing with this for about 15 years now. Some days are better than others, some days are pure hell. I'm starting a new job next week and I'm currently not on any medications and I'M SO SCARED. I have to go into the office for a week or two of training and then into the office once a week. I've quit jobs before due to anxiety and have been working as a VA for a bit now to avoid going into an office but I'm high key panicking and I know I need this job if I don't want to be broke after the next year. But this health issue screws up everything for me all of the time.

I've done tons of research and I keep coming across different mental illnesses that I semi relate to but not quite. Does anyone have the same symptoms as me and a proper diagnosis? I need to get this fixed as it's ruining my life and every doctor/psychologist I've gone to just tells me to exercise (I do everyday), get blood work done (I'm healthy, no thyroid issues), and take anti psychotics (don't work, they hurt my head and GIVE ME ANXIETY). 

I am very fortunate to have a loving partner that tries his hardest to understand and be patient with me, we have a nice home together and two kitties, and I fear one day I will lose everything because I can't hold a job for more than a year. I'm almost 29 and need to get my shit together and if doctors can't help me, I need to help push them in the right direction I guess. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like these issues require medical attention and I just keep getting blown off. I also used to do drugs and have attempted suicide several times as an adult and I feel that's part of the reasons doctors won't bother with me.

rape them. rape your roommates. touch them after they come out of the shower

(right after I come out of the shower I think) they're all watching you, they can see your pubes and hairy legs and they think you're disgusting. they all think you're a freak and gross and that's why they're not using your pronouns correctly. 

they don't use the same bathroom and shower as you purposely, they're scared you're going to molest them or do weird/perverted shit to their belongings if you share a shower. they're all scared of you. they hate you for being nonbinary because they think you might have a dick or might become a man, and they wanted only female roommates

everyone hates you, and your old roommate is entirely justified in hating you and purposely excluding you from things. you creeped your friends out by telling them things about your sex life and they keep playing truth or dare to ask you sexual questions because they like to use you like a clown. you're a source of entertainment for them but even then, you're not part of their group and never will be. they're all scared you're going to molest them. your male friend, in particular, doesn't like you because your extra effort to befriend them is coming off as creepy and they feel like you're hitting on them

the only reason why you have one good friend is that she's spying on you for your old roommate. she doesn't actually like you and tells your roommate EVERYTHING you guys talk about

just get a pair of tweezers to pluck the individual hairs from your head it'd be so much more effective than your fingers and scissors. use rusty tweezers so that it gets infected and your scalp hurts more til it's covered in scabs and bleeding so you can scratch at them and pick at them until you bleed out and die

you deserve death. you're so fucking disgusting. (I'm a virgin but my brain says:) you're such a slut. your cunt is so loose and you're going to accidentally take your own virginity through the way you masturbate. you want it taken, don't you? you would let any man that showed you a hint of love or affection take it from you. it's going to hurt but you'd enjoy that. you want to feel the pain. the only reason you like BDSM and having a dominant is that it gives you an excuse to self-harm without calling it self harm.

I wouldn't say I had a huge issue with alcohol years ago, having a few drinks a year at best unless I wanted to treat myself to a jack or rum and coke once or twice a month. I don't think I'd really start to amp up by having one or two late at night after having an argument with my partner or getting triggered over something else. 

The same goes for drugs, which for me was benzos when I was abruptly yanked off them without tapering down from what I remember. That was close to ten years ago, and fuck, part of me still misses them even though I never used recreationally - but I admitted to being tempted. I remember telling someone this and they said that when we were going to tend to an out of state family emergency, they knew someone who could possibly hook me up. It was very hard to resist the temptation, but I ultimately did. However, this is the same person who got mad at me years later for talking about admitting to myself that I might have a problem if I miss them that much - again, even though years earlier they were okay with enabling me.

Now my life is in the shitter and it's hard to not get into that head space of wanting to use to manage my stress.

For as long as i can remember, I‚Äôve always coped with anger by looking at the situation inside of my head. I imagine that i hurt the people that I‚Äôm angry at in that moment. The thoughts first took form as a simple cursing, curse words. Then it developed; i see myself stabbing them, slicing their throats open. Hammering a nail inside of them, slicing their heads like they‚Äôre pizza. A quick reminder: this all took place inside of my head. I realistically can‚Äôt see myself actually performing it, nor that i have the guts and immorality to do so. For as long as i can remember, the development started when i was 14. It definitely has been occurring beforehand, just not in that form of hurting people (by slicing them, as mentioned). I never wanted to think like that, I cant seem to help my thoughts. 

I‚Äôm the eldest child. Growing up, my parents have little to no knowledge about handling children‚Äôs issues and how to guide them. So whenever i get angry, they always get mad at me, and it always ends in myself apologizing to them. I never knew that i could express anger, even with excitement they only say that I‚Äôm being dramatic.

I didn‚Äôt know that my emotions were invalidated, but I‚Äôve always thought of how unfair it was, how they‚Äôre allowed to express anger and i am not.

And me, having two younger siblings, pressured to be ‚Äúan example‚Äù to them, that i have to take care of them. My first ‚Äúduty‚Äù as the eldest was that i have to prepare my sister‚Äôs school uniform and her school books every day of the week. That made me angrier. I was 8 at that moment, having no guidance on studies, schedule management, how to face issues and solve problems of my own, parents busy with parenting their other kids. I flunked elementary school. 

I was 9 when i got SA by one of my neighbors, they took my stockings off in front of the neighborhood‚Äôs field where everyone was playing basketball and such. Dad was angry, not at them but at me. He screamed at me to call mom about what just happened. I got grounded and wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave the house for the next few months. He created a schedule timetable of how i should live for the next days. 
I wasn‚Äôt angry nor that i felt sad, i was confused. What is it that i do wrong?

That reminds me, there was also a time where i would play with the kids in my neighborhood, i went to a short gathering with them, like a barbecue party. There was a feud between my parents and theirs that i knew nothing about. When my parents found out, they dragged me out and brought me home. I was angry, i just wanted to play with my friends. My grandma came and thought that i was possessed, (she‚Äôs religious lol)

Im sorry for being so out of the topic and for venting, but i hope that‚Äôll illustrate some of the anger that i stored throughout my life. 

Back to the topic, i started to hide my emotions, it felt like i was tip toe-ing around everyone i came across. In my mind, i have to treat them like they‚Äôre glass. 

I know and acknowledge that I should be the one fixing all this mess up. Im the one who have control over myself, so im the one to blame of how think. I know that the thoughts that came to mind was resulted by all those years of storing ill emotions. I want to stop thinking this way, to express my anger, but i still want to maintain the reserved persona.

This best friend of mine was fiercely competitive. She used ro make back-handed remarks about my appearance and personality to raise her own self esteem. She was obsessed with presenting as a chill, no drama, ""pure"" person who never had a bad thought about anyone, even while manipulating me and causing me grief. She would want me to cut off ties with friends so that we could get closer, but ultimately it was her who walked away from the friendship when we started university. The list goes on and on. But tl;dr, she was an all-round manipulative, jealous and fake person and I was affected deeply by this.

It's been nearly 6 years since we last spoke and I'm still not coping. I have vivid dreams of her, sometimes of her apologising for ghosting me and being shitty, but often of her doing well and achieving goals while I fail at the task at hand. 

I've tried to get in touch via Facebook but she has her messenger set to ""only friends can message me"", because she has always had to have the last word - even when life is treating her just fine. So I cannot contact her and vent. 

Last night I had a dream of stabbing her. I often daydream about beating her up even though I know I'd get sent to prison.  I've seen her around town about twice since she we cut contact and she has run off, avoiding eye contact. I get such a rush at the thought of chasing her up the street and breaking her nose.

She knows how much she has hurt me, and I want to make her pay. I have spoken to friends and therapists about this but absolutely no one understands my obsession. They tell me to let it go but it's not that easy. They're worried about me. I'm worried about me.

My mind is always fucking with me. Sometimes it‚Äôs my mood or other psychological features ‚Äî most of the time it‚Äôs my thinking and psychomotor function.

Recently my thoughts have kind of turned into their own entity and are beginning to impact my ability to get along with daily life.

One of the most prominent and disturbing thoughts is the idea I‚Äôm going to develop schizophrenia.

I‚Äôve dealt with some psychotic issues in my life. Mostly extreme paranoid ideation and (when it‚Äôs bad) hallucinations to validate that paranoia. One time during a very intense depressive episode I became delusional, although I hardly remember any of that.

These psychotic issues only make the thoughts stronger ‚Äî I feel like I‚Äôm going through some sort of prodromal phase and that soon enough I‚Äôm going to break away from reality and lose my life.

I wish to talk about this with my therapist but the intrusive thoughts continuously tell me that I shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äî that no one cares and that I‚Äôm a fraud for even considering someone may take me seriously.

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and unspecified anxiety for quite some time but I haven‚Äôt had these symptoms since before beginning medication and recovering as much as possible from severe depression.

It makes me feel so awful. 

It's so bad because it's about inappropriate people. Like, family, really young or old people, anything. 

What's even worse is that I've had them so long I don't feel that 'revulsion' or 'disgust' like I used to. So, many times I don't push it away. I just 'observe' to see what sort of monstrosity my brain is coming up with.

Then I feel even worse because I didn't push it away, that must mean I'm a bad person and I like it? I must enjoy this if I don't feel that rush of anxiety through my body like i used to, and if I don't push it away the moment it arises? 

I still feel like absolute rubbish after them though.

And I just know I hate myself and hate my mind and hate it all.

I don't even know if it's me imagining them or not. I have been told I have OCD, and one of my compulsions was to imagine them to prove I (my body) wouldn't react to them. It sounds stupid I know but I thought, arousal = attraction, so if I don't get it I'm okay!

Ha. Wish someone told me as a teenage girl it's normal to get it from literally anything related to this topic.

I'm 24 currently and since I was around 14, I've just had these feelings of anger towards other people. My dad would tell me stories about how he was beaten by religious people randomly in the street for not being the same religion as them. I only found out today that he was trespassing on their property and knowing him like I do, he probably was being aggressive and threatening.

I look back on certain tales of his that he has told me about this community and I wonder if they are true. These stories have tortured me for years and have fed into untold amounts of anxiety. It was a constant thing, that these people were 'dirty' etc. I even went through a period of having quite extreme views. All this stems from his stories. It was built on those and escalated over many years of repeated assertions that they were horrid.

He's lied about other things before and I'm really annoyed at him for affecting my mental health like he has over the years. I can't go into everything but he's affected me in many ways. He's very quick to defend Hitler, saying he had nothing to do with all the stuff that happened.

but tonight i woke up and the anxiety wasn't that bad?? which horrified me because it made me think i may be accepting the fact that i am becoming a pedophile or that it's not wrong. ive been researching on ocd and pocd ever since this thing started, which would make a lot of sense because a lot of these intrusive thoughts turn into obsession. but im scared that my thoughts right and may just be in denial?

We are interested in hearing from people who identify as having obsessional and compulsive problems, and those without current experiences of mental health difficulties.

We are hoping to develop a deeper understanding of factors that may contribute to distress in this area, with the hope of tailoring and improving treatments for these individuals.

We are looking for volunteers aged 18 years and over. Participating in the research will take approximately 1 hour, and will involve a short telephone discussion, an experimental task via video, and completion of some questionnaires.

They range from pertaining to our relationship, sexualizing almost everything, and harming himself and others. We have just recently figured out that it is OCD. When we were dating he would always say he had thoughts that he felt like, ""someone else was putting there."" So, I had no idea what he was talking about. 

His thoughts have continued to get worse and over time he decided to start telling me what they were. They are really bad and hurtful. I finally got him to realize that he can't share his thoughts with me because of how damaging it is to our relationship. 

But now, I just think the things for him. When we are eating at a restaurant and we see a girl I know he would find attractive, I think about him thinking all of the things he wants to do to her.

At this point, I do not know what to do. Psychiatrists around here have a 9 month long waitlist. 

My husband is now so depressed that he won't work, help around the house, or take care of our newborn.

Might be a long shot, but do you guys have any advice?

I'm a 25 year old autistic man.
As part of my neurodiverse social group, I started going to the gym.
I had a great time.
I enjoyed the workout but I also enjoyed the women in tight shorts that were around me, especially the one who looks like Kate Micucci who was wearing headphones.
The other day, I made a post asking for advice on how to approach her without being creepy and most of the comments I got were from women telling me that if I want to approach her in that environment, that makes me a creep.
Some of them also said that I should say hi to everyone so that it's not too unusual when I say to hi to her.
Right now, I'm thinking about just focusing more on the workout and leaving everyone alone.
I feel shame about the way that I looked at those women, and I was advised in another post to use that as a reminder to not look at them again.

I can cope with most of the thoughts, but some of them straight up terrify me. they include:
- suicidal ideas
- self destructive ideas

- harming or killing animals
- sexual ideas, often violent too. I'm asexual so these are really unpleasant to have (as if they aren't to begin with)

I think about choking them with a phone cord or beating them with the chairs in the breakroom. I think about spraying them with pepper gel or shining a bright light in their eyes until they go permanently blind.

These thoughts have been severely effecting me and my parents 

When I have a thought I always get really mad due to the contents of the thoughts and how I would hate to be in that situation, so when I experience a thought I have a physical reaction, like making a sudden movement, or saying something to myself like ""shut up"" or ""okay that's enough I'm gonna go drink water now"" and then not doing that , all of these end up concerning my parents a lot, because I look like I'm going crazy when I just randomly spit out something like ""okay leave me alone"" when I am alone in my room

But that's just the easy part, I always have thoughts about arguing with people about stuff, and I always end up arguing with them In real life too, as in I would be experiencing a thought in my brain, and I would physically speak to myself in real life with the thoughts and argue with them, and this also has scared my family a lot, Because I would just be sitting there sometimes even with them in the car, and I'd just start talking to myself angrily

2 days ago I was sitting in my room and drawing I was having some extremely uncomfortable intrusive thoughts and I just couldn't take it anymore so I stood up and SCREAMED from the top of my lungs, witch terrified my parents and made my mother cry

And I don't know what to do now, I already went to therapy last year for a possible OCD diagnosis and took ERP but at the end therapist said I didn't have it, I wanna go there again but my parents won't let me because they don't want me to think I have another disorder

I tried looking up stuff online, the most common way to stop anxiety intrusive thoughts is through ignoring the thought and not engaging with it and essentially desensitizing yourself to it, but I simply cannot stop engaging and arguing with these thoughts without zoning out and forgetting about it , I heard that maybe trying to ignore them for a certain time, like 30 minutes for example would help but I am yet to try that

Like I don't know what to do now, I have to study but I can't do that properly, and sometimes I can't even pay attention in class, and my parents are losing their minds and it's effecting their physical health too, maybe I should look up more reddit threads of poeple instead of YouTube videos about intrusive thoughts?",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,88916,public,self,Been struggling a lot with anxiety intrusive thoughts and don't know how to stop them,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/sx09po/been_struggling_a_lot_with_anxiety_intrusive/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time it was just me noting it as a possibility with no true intent to have the end of my life occur, just ya know, accepting it.

He left his phone. He might not have meant it to hurt, but it did. Because he's not wrong. Nobody calls me on my phone, nobody texts, my phone is just an over glorified music player.

I shall give a somewhat detailed description of the situation, you must think about it and I‚Äôll add my own opinion at the end.  

I was thinking, I am a man so if I were to commit a violent crime, it probably would have to involve rape, because why not if the opportunity is there anyways.  So I was thinking if in the middle of the night, break into a home where I know a mother, father, daughter, son.  The kids being around 10 or 11, the parents still young and attractive.  I would of course kill the father as he‚Äôs of no use and the biggest physical threat.  I can‚Äôt shoot as it would wake the kids and alert neighbors.  I would have to slice his throat, I know once doesn‚Äôt guarantee death so I guess I would keep dragging the blade across a dozen times.  She would be held down and mouth covered, told to stay quiet or I‚Äôll kill the kids.  I would then cover her mouth with tape and strip her clothes off, I wouldn‚Äôt hurt her at that moment.  Before the kids come in I would touch her and maybe stick my fingers in her.  Then I would sneak into the kids room and scare them enough to where they stayed silent.  Then I bring them in with the mother.  

1: I rape the son, daughter, and mother.  Then kill the kids first.  

2: I rape the mother first and kill her in front of the kids.  

Both scenarios everyone dies.

I choose 1 as the mother has more of a connection to her kids, more emotional development.  The kids would probably just cry since they can‚Äôt fully understand the situation.  She would break completely and I could probably just leave.

I don't understand. When people said it's common, I thought my thoughts were what most people experience. Moving images in my mind. Or sounds. Or both with a narrator.

So for me it was never 'what if I do this?'. It was more like *an actual imagination of doing something*. It was not 'what if' 'i want' etc. 

I feel even worse. I get full on visions of nasty things. Not just words. It's a full on imagination. I thought this is was intrusive thoughts are. Do others have this or?

That's why I was confused with the groinal response to. That people get arousal at words or things like that? I thought it was logical because if you imagine something sexual then it makes sense to get aroused. So now I feel even worse, that I don't qualify for OCD anymore.

About a month ago I started getting intrusive thoughts about hurting myself and others. I've never had them before. Whenever I'm in the kitchen near the knives I get an urge to take a knife and stab myself in the stomach or stab my eyes out. In class I feel an urge to scream when it's silent. It feels like I can just barely stop myself. When I wait for the train I feel an extreme urge to push somebody or to jump in front of the train myself. One day it was so bad it felt like my legs were about to start running towards the train any second. I had to grip the wall to atleast somehow stop myself. I get thoughts about poisoning my family and have an urge to drink dozens of pills at a time. I think about ripping my eyes out and cutting my limbs off. Because of the stress of rotating through these thoughts everyday for months, I've also been going through a lot of depersonalization/derealization. I feel like I'm on a movie set, a Sims character mindlessly existing. I had to touch my bed the other day to make sure it was real and even though I could feel it I still couldn't convince myself that I'm not in a simulation and I almost had a full blown panic attack. At one point I was convinced that my mom was evil when she would look at me. It was something about her eyes. Today my newest urge has been literally doing black magic on people to kill them which is FUCKING INSANE. I don't know how to make the thoughts stop. I've read a lot about ocd but the intrusive thoughts are described as thinking something you'd never actually do. My thoughts feel like urges the more I think about them so I don't know if this would be characterized as ocd. I do have a history of OCD though. Specifically, drawing specific images and letters in my head over and over, checking and rechecking until I'm satisfied, touching things a specific amount of times, etc. I realize I need therapy but I'm scared I'm going to get taken to a psych ward as suicidal and homicidal ideation are both reasons for therapists to report in the U.S. Any advice or commentary you could give would be highly appreciated.

You're not there for me and all I ever asked was for a friend to be there for another friend.

I didn't do all of this stuff to buy or win favoritism. I was raised where, friendships mattered. You do things for that friendship to sweeten them. To cherish them. But when friendships stopped feeling like friendships, you have to just pack it all up and go. You've done all you could and it'll suck to walk away from the memories that you had with them, but that's what life is.

I've given so much to where I don't have anything left to give and it's costing me now. That's my limit and you finally found it.

And the more I keep these friends, then all that I'm doing is hurting myself and just making up weak excuses to keep some of you people. It takes me a while because I keep hoping things will turn around or improve, only to see that they don't.

&lt;STORY STARTS BELOW&gt;

My surgeon told me it was an unnecessary surgery after he removed all four. 

All three of my wisdom grew in straight and one was slightly tilted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before getting my wisdom teeth  removed I was referred to surgeon D ( not his real name). I was experiencing ear pain and my Dr.A ( not their real name either) said there was no other way to get rid of the pain unless I had this surgery.  I think the surgery was a cash grab. I was being Pressured by Dr. A. they said ""your insurance is ending I would get this surgery soon if I were you before it ends"". 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been five months after surgery and The ear pain is even worse, it has spread to my face and neck. I got a new doctor and they diagnosed me with Acute temporomandibular joint disorder ( Acute TMJ). I regret not seeking another opinion. It would be beneficial if all doctors give more options for treatment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let surgery be the last resort, As I didn't need my wisdom teeth removed. 

I have been searching the internet for why wisdom teeth are removed in some cases it is necessary but I have seen there are ways to prevent their removal during adolescents.

I remember reading a study a while back that stated that wisdom teeth extractions can develop sleep apnea, amongst other problems that develop with wisdom teeth extractions.

&amp;#x200B;

if you made it this far thank you for listening, my goal is to make a discord group so we could support each other with resources to prevent the issues that come with removing wisdom teeth as well as help others from unnecessarily getting their wisdom teeth removed. I feel this group will help my anxiety and others like me too.

-almost everyone gets ‚Äúintrusive thoughts‚Äù.
-people usually just brush them off instead of responding to them‚Äî

this shows that thoughts are not the problem, it‚Äôs our response to them that is. we can‚Äôt control our thoughts, but what we can control is how we react to them.‚Äî

these thoughts are our brain trying to help us, telling us ‚Äúhere‚Äôs something bad that could happen‚Äù. overreacting to them, arguing with them, ruminating on them, or even just labeling them as ‚Äúan intrusive thought‚Äù are all compulsions that tell our brain that this thought is a threat, and something must be done about it which causes our brain to bring it up again and again.‚Äî

instead, try just acknowledging that yes, that is a thought, and carry on with what you were doing. by not overreacting, our brain won‚Äôt perceive it as a threat, and won‚Äôt keep firing the thought.‚Äî

my brain has been giving me thoughts about mainly harm, but instead of fighting the thoughts, i accept that it was just a thought and move on. accept that you are human, and humans get thoughts. ‚Äî 

don‚Äôt worry about what you can‚Äôt control, there‚Äôs no point. instead, control your response to those thoughts. ‚Äî

im so proud of everyone trying their best right now. you are amazing for being so strong, regardless of what your thoughts tell you. and remember, you are not a bad person. the fact that you are concerned proves it. ‚Äî stay strong, it gets better.

At the start of the year I was attacked by a dog, had PTSD and then caught the unnamed disease which tipped me over the edge. Have been seeing a therapist since and made great leaps. Work is going well I think; was happy to return after lockdown. 
Anyway, went on vacation a month ago the build up was extremely stressful, from trying to avoid catching the unnamed beforehand to driving through the snow to the airport.
Landed in the country I‚Äôve been to at least 10 times and was happy to be there, then boom wake up day 2 and I have a UTI. Went and got antibiotics before it got worse and they kicked me into a pit I am now struggling to get out of. First day of antibiotics I woke up from a dream that I was jumping off the balcony, I then had a horrific panic attack, haven‚Äôt had a panic attack in &amp; months. For 2 days afterwards I was getting extreme vertigo walking upto the room and my legs had turned to jelly. Felt like I was battling with my mind to not jump off the balcony. Eventually was moved to a ground floor room which helped. 
As antibiotic thoughts continued I stopped them and went to a doctor who prescribed me a different brand. He also gave me diazepam after I told him about the thoughts. I‚Äôve never taken any anxiety meds so was keen to avoid having to take them.
Flash forwards 3 days, UTI had gone but my mind was suffocating me. Suicidal thoughts all day and I have never had them before. I can‚Äôt grasp the feeling. I returned home and I can‚Äôt settle at home. It feels like I can‚Äôt look forward to anything and I‚Äôm now wondering if I will ever feel happy again, questioning life in general and wondering if I‚Äôve ever actually been happy. 
I have got through so much this year I just don‚Äôt understand where the thoughts have come from and how I can get through it. 
Any help is much appreciated as I just want to feel like I did a month ago not questioning every feeling and every thought.
I don‚Äôt want to die but I‚Äôm struggling to find purpose or point at the moment. It‚Äôs a very dark place. 
Every time I think about suicide or death I feel physically sick. 
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm exhausted or actually suicidal? Its all I can think about. I don‚Äôt know if questioning everything is making it worse.

Sickening. Absolutely demoralising vivid images form in my head every day. Unimagineable awful stuff. Things i dread and would never ever dream of happening in my life. Sometimes it's better and I only get a few in a day but when it's bad it's... Bad.

Three years ago it started. It was just an image of me and my dad doing soemthing gross. I panicked for a solid week. Then I felt off and guilty about feeling off around my dad.

A year later I was praying and my mind literally went ""what if I think of Jesus in a sexual way?"" I panicked and tried to stop it but the images were forming in my mind. Then about my guardian angel. I felt sick. That was when I stopped praying without fear. Afterwards it was praying full of guilt and anxiety.

It later developed to full on visions of sex things about Mary, Jesus, the devil, everyone religious. And me. And messed up stuff.

Then it just... Settled down for a while. Last year it was really good. Like really really good. But in the past few months it went soooo downhill. The same images but about my grandma. Or dad. Or aunt. Or the cat I saw down the street. Or just the old images from the past. Nasty stuff.

It just got so bad it was the end of me. I had na image of my little brother. That was it. I was done. Nope. Too much. Cried every day, couldn't sleep, lost 5kg in weight. Horrid stuff.

I decided to end it all, end my anxiety, by 'checking' myself. I imagined some gross image to prove I wouldn't get aroused. And I did. If I knew beforehand I had OCD I would've never done the checking, which is apparently a compulsion.

Then on Christmas I had images of my dad. I felt sick and ashamed and guilty. I started checking myself by images of my mum because I was so scared of it affecting her too. Bad mistake. Unwanted arousal is real and awful. I hate myself.

Everyone is telling me I'm not my fears I'm not a bad person and it's just OCD and obsessive thoughts. But I feel so awful. I literally feel like the worst person on the planet. I ruined Christmas because I was depressed and my mum was worried. She was the most supportive for me. I love her so much. But I feel so disgusting. For imagining such disgusting things.

I am now out of school because I couldn't concentrate and function. Therapy (CBT) has done nothing. My only hope is medication. But I still can't forget the messed up things I did. Unwanted images, okay. I could live with. Somehow. But checking myself???

Please tell me there are others like this out there.

It's always the same basic thing with a different spin. I am disabled and I can't work or get disability because I am ""too young"" and my disease isn't well known or accepted as enough to not be able to work. So therapy is not an option for me. Thing is, my intrusive thoughts (mixed with CPTSD) are making my health worst because of how stressful they are.

tw: graphic violence, psychological torture.

It started when someone ""catfish me"" (idk if it's the appropriate term) and made me believe I knew members my favorite band and that they were their biological family. Things got mixed up with supernatural stuff and I felt for it because I grew up with a mom that believed in that stuff, I was naive and an impressionable teen. It was not so bad at the biggening but at some point, the person made me believe they were getting kidnapped and tortured and I would talk with the characters they created to find a way to get them out of whatever horrible trouble they were in. It was a pretty regular thing and I started constantly having intrusive thoughts about all that could happen to them and thinking about all the ways I could possibly offer help/ solve the problems to keep 'em safe. Other characters started to also get kidnaped and tortured including one of em who I considered my best friend. At some point he was trapped in a wooden box who would fill up with water slowly as I was texting him and well, he ended up telling me the water was too high and stopped texting me for a while. I freaked out and texted him a bunch. Another character texted me telling me he was safe now. (The person who made up the story told me they actually wanted to kill him but that they saw my reaction and changed their mind). I realized not long after that the person who catfish me was catfishing me and that the characters weren't real, but it was also making 4 years, I would text some of the characters daily, so it took me a while to confront them. The initial reaction was ""I'm hurt you think I 'm not real"" so I stopped but I confronted them again a few months after and they admitted what they did.   


Now I keep on having intrusive thoughts about people I love dying or getting hurt, I think I've got harm OCD and I keep on having daily hours long intrusive thoughts about meeting the actual band and telling them about it and getting to be friends. I actually wrote a long letter to them talking about this minus the supernatural part that I don't touch in this post, and it didn't help much (except to stop drinking and cut off contact with the catfisher).

I feel like Pure OCD has just made me a ball of emotions hiding behind a happy face because I can‚Äôt share this with hardly anyone in real life. 
I just don‚Äôt know how to convince myself that I‚Äôm good and want good things.
I also can‚Äôt convince myself that I always have disapproved of all the awful things my brain has thrown my way, and due to feeling so numb in recent days by thoughts of violence, rape and killing, I worry I am evil.

I think sometimes the only way to preserve myself and live a self serving productive life (financial stability, concentration in work)  is to become evil and not care about anything or anyone but myself - but I really don‚Äôt like to think that way.

The only thing I feel is emptiness, and discomfort/uneasiness.

Literally I started having awful thoughts of harm being done to my family. But I feel nothing. Just numb and empty and discomfort. I don't like playing the 'imaginations' out because I feel uneasy.

Is this basically numbed anxiety? I used to feel so anxious and sick but now I feel nothing. Am I developing psychopathy? Sociopathy? Or what? 

I literally had an imagination of my beloved mum being (TW) cut open, ripped into shreds and being eaten. Or my family's heads being chopped off. Or me being dismembered. Or children being abused. Or me slicing my neck. I feel a weight in my chest, discomfort, my heart starts pounding but my mind can't stop replaying it. My mind won't stop.

Everyone says I'm highly empathetic, caring, so kind, and I'm just honestly terrified because I feel nothing.

Everyone avoids you if they don't have a reason to speak with you. 

Why do you do this to yourself? 

You know already nobody likes you that way, and frankly, nobody will. You've been called a weirdo since childhood even by your own family, as an adult that hasn't change. People may act as though they like you, but they're only doing that to use you. Why don't you realize that yet? 

You've already seen yourself be used time and time again. For money, for food, even just as company to be kicked out after they feel better about themselves and don't need nor want you around. 

Even your own real life friends talk about you behind your back, you've heard them in person for yourself! Sure, if they knew you heard they'd apologize, but they wouldn't be sorry. There's no need for them to be. It was just their opinion, they're already in a relationship so of course the idea of dating you would be repulsive enough to elicit an aggravated sigh and ""ew."" And you can't fault them. People say you're handsome, but that's all to boost your ego and make you placid and more easily managed.

You'd be so much better off if you just stopped trying to make friends. Stopped being friends! And don't even bother with dating... 

You're just as oblivious to other's advances as you are clueless about what it means to truly love anyone. Family, friends, makes no difference but once again you can't admit to yourself. Just give up on it, stop trying to find out what it feels like. Unconditional love doesn't exist, and even if it did it's trivial. A fleeting deluge of chemicals in the brain deluding you into a false calm. It's pointless thinking. All of it is pointless! So stop already!

Ever since then whenever I would see something like a meme that remind me of them I would feel guilty. It got repetitive and I didn‚Äôt like how often I remembered him because I didn‚Äôt want to. Normally it wouldn‚Äôt mean anything. But because of the guilt, the thoughts became to mean something. I would keep rationalizing and pushing it away. But it keeps coming back. It‚Äôs kind of like not having given him closure and stuff. Guilty conscience. Anyways these thoughts would later change to like liking the things he would do for me and stuff like that. I really didn‚Äôt, and I haven‚Äôt felt like that about him. So it made me uncomfortable to think so and even more so at the thought of confronting him. Four years passed and theoughts were still as bad, now I got intrusive throughts about other people and things tooo. So at some point I msged him saying sorry and all and that it‚Äôs for the best. I didn‚Äôt feel anything when I msged him nor when he replied. My thoughts were not true. However the thoughts I had now had several paths. A while after I finished the conversation I got a thought that said maybe you liked what he said. And the cycle went on. Now the guilt of closure was gone but the guilt of the thoughts remained. Till today it doesn‚Äôt go away and I find myself thinking what if it‚Äôs true. I know it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôve had boyfriends I loved . I have one right now who I love more than anything in the world.

When you dissociate, aren't your thoughts supposed to be more comfortable than reality?

Sometimes they are. Sometimes they are terrifying.  I find myself in a storyline in which I am a completely different person in a completely different family. Sometimes this family is great, but most of the time this family does horrible things to me. I feel all the emotions from these thoughts. Anger, stress, fear, and sadness. I don't know how to get out of my own head.

I personally suspect that I have pure O OCD although I may not find a doctor willing to consider this diagnosis (my current one isn't so gone on the whole OCD thing and just sees this as a part of my larger anxiety problem).

My question is whether intrusive thoughts are predominantly/only seen in OCD or whether this is also something that people who only meet the diagnostic criteria for GAD (or mixed anxiety/depression) also commonly experience?

I'm a male in his mid 30s diagnosed with anxiety and depression. My anxiety has a very strong obsessional component that I believe sounds awfully like pure O, although I haven't been diagnosed yet.

I only came across the term intrusive thoughts last night. I've been having these for so long that they seem totally normal to me. I see that either they or the reaction to them is not. So they're now on my list of things to discuss when I next see my doctor.

The visions I get throughout the day are basically whatever could go wrong in a given circumstance.

The other day I was on a nature walk and stopped to take in a beautiful view on top of a steep hill.

Instantly my brain flashed to what would happen if I lost my footing. I saw myself tumbling down the hill face like a ragdoll ad my head was cut on a rock and split open.

Later yesterday I was using my bathroom and almost knocked over a glass jar that I didn't realize we even had there to store toothbrushes.

I had an intrusive thought of what would happen if I had actually knocked over the jar. The glass would have shattered. I swear shards flying into my legs and lacerating my foot.

Like most intrusive thoughts these only last for a couple of seconds. But they're basically a constant throughout the day for me. Whatever can go wrong in a given situation, my brain will throw up the mental image of that actually taking place.

I've had intrusive thoughts for a long time, so I'm used to them, and I've always had thoughts of self harm or suicide. Nothing that I would ever act on, I don't actually want to die or harm myself, and I've never done anything in the past either, but thoughts of it come and go in waves. 

Recently I started university and one of my classmates had a lot of scars on her arms and my brain instantly latched on to this and wanted me to cut myself on the arm. Not the wrist but on a really weird spot on the arm. As usual I just brushed this off and went about my week as normal!

Note that I'm also being treated for a possible personality disorder that carries with it periods of mania, which clouds my judgment and ability to think about consequences. My medicine to control this mania recently ran out and I've been out of refills, so my emotions have been a bit unstable, making this urge to cut a slit in my arm a lot more difficult to handle. 

I've also had a bunch of dreams of killing myself in a manic rage as a way to prove a point, and I'm getting concerned that in these dreams I cannot stop myself from going through with it. 

I've never cut myself before, never self harmed in any way but food restriction and sleep deprivation before, and I sleep and eat on a strict schedule now to prevent that, but it feels like the mania is taking over and I can't stop myself from worrying what I might do. I don't think I will hurt myself, but the thought is just so loud in my head and the spot my brain has decided I need tho cut into feels itchy and taut, as if it WANTS me to cut it open for some release,  even though I know this isn't true.

I just needed to vent and write this out, my partner gets so worried whenever I mention that my brain is being mean and I don't want to worry him.

I used to feel so much panic I couldn't eat or sleep. Now, after dealing with horrific thoughts for three months straight, day after day, all day, I've gotten tired. 

I had intnede sexual intrusive thoughts, the really horrid types I won't even type out, and while i still get them and it frustrates me, the intense anxiety and everything is mostly gone after working with a therapist.

A few days ago literally out of nowhere I started getting horrid violent thoughts. Luckily not frequently, but they disturb me so much. Literally started out of nowhere. I just remember getting a sudden faint image of a man and just knowing he was being hurt. Like o heard inside my head shouts. The image, thank goodness, was barely there so I didn't actually visualise it but it was the sound my mind created.

Then later I suddenly got an image of my family. It's disturbing and I try not to think about it but the images resurface every now and then and it freaks me out, I feel super uncomfortable and uneasy. It's not nice, getting an image of your families heads just rolling off or something. Or an image of someone hurting them with a chainsaw or something. It freaked me out because 1. I hate violence and I hate horror and anything like that 2. It's just terrifying, I don't even know where the truck my mind came up with that from, I don't watch those kinds of things and I never had any violent thougths at all. 

Now I know it might be OCD (I was told I most likely have OCD by a doctor and therapist) but it's torture. These thoughts are horrific and scary. Every time I get them I want to escape from my own body because it's horrible. I shake my head, squeeze my eyes and try to redirect my thoughts because I don't want them to possibly 'play out' more or morph into something worse, and I don't want to focus on them because they're awful and make me feel sick.

I cried already and I couldn't focus for a while.

I‚Äôm sorry if half of this doesn‚Äôt make sense. I had to take breaks between writing.)

I‚Äôm just looking for help. I don‚Äôt know what it is and it won‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôve been dealing with this for years. Maybe 10 years, but it‚Äôs gotten so much worse within the past 5 years or so. 

I don‚Äôt even really know how to say this. But my boyfriend has noticed me staring at nothing. Or even I‚Äôll catch myself staring at nothing and not even realize that what I was just doing, was getting lost in the darkest places in my head. 

I‚Äôll hear myself making comments about things. But it‚Äôs not me who is doing it. I mean yeah it‚Äôs my voice but it sounds mean. And it hates me. And everyone. It wants nothing to do with everything. I even accidentally mentioned it in a car that I was arguing with myself. And I mentioned the name, ‚ÄúRose.‚Äù Which is the name I gave the voice several years ago. My boyfriend was so confused when I said that. 

I never really thought about comparing Rose to the voice before. I used to think I had a split personality. Or a multiple personality discord. But it never really came forth. It always stayed in my head.

And no I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs another person named Rose inside of me. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs another personality. I could be wrong though. 

But that‚Äôs not the only thing. 

Yes. I have conversations with the voice. We argue. I can‚Äôt understand the reasoning behind the voice. I mean it‚Äôs literally me. Except I can‚Äôt control it. When I tell it to stop. It doesn‚Äôt stop. When I try absolutely anything. With all of my power. It. Will. Not. Stop. It‚Äôs driving me crazy. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just really bad intrusive thoughts or what. 

I play out scenarios that would never happen. A lot of the stuff doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Like I could be eating a bowl of cereal for example and suddenly I‚Äôm 30 minutes into a thought process about how I‚Äôd get away with murder. Or something absurd. 

My mind plays images, like videos of all kinds of scenarios of me just losing my shit. Just not caring. Giving up. Killing people. Killing myself. 

And just a while ago the thought crossed my mind. I‚Äôm only alive because of my cat. Because I love him so much. I could never leave him. But I hate this world so bad. When he dies, I‚Äôll die too. And I can‚Äôt believe the next thought I had. I can hardly bring myself to type it. 
Just if I‚Ä¶ ended his life. I could end mine. It hurts me so much to think that I would ever have that thought pass my mind. I mean my cat is my everything. I‚Äôd rather die for him to live. 

On another note, I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs related. But I need to sleep with a light on because in the dark, I see things. People, creatures. 

I hate going out where people are because my mind trails off and I just imagine what people‚Äôs thoughts are when looking at me. 

My boyfriend caught me staring at nothing when we were on the road and he asked what‚Äôs wrong. I snapped out of it and said awkwardly said I was wondering how to kill a cop. 

I don‚Äôt even remember why I started thinking about it. Or what brought it on. I didn‚Äôt even realize I was thinking about it until my boyfriend asked me. 

Voice: Do it. Fucking kill yourself. You dumb bitch. Hurry the fuck up and just do it. We‚Äôve waited long enough.

Voice: What if I were to kill him right now. How would I do it. There‚Äôs no knives in the room except for his pocket knife on the floor. 

(I was staring at him while I typed that and didn‚Äôt even realize and he caught me. What the fuck is wrong with my mind. I hate myself. Why do I get lost and fall into these thoughts.) I‚Äôd never go through with anything malicious. It‚Äôs not me.

I recently began the process of getting officially diagnosed and getting medical treatment at 28. It‚Äôs been a pretty jarring experience in general but the fact that i live somewhere where mental healthcare is still kinda stigmatised,there are not many specialised professionals available, and getting appointments takes months has been especially challenging cause i end up having to sort of lowkey therapyse myself? And bitch let me tell you‚Ä¶i do not have the qualifications

However, this one has actually been helping so here it goes

As a consequence of growing up undiagnosed, i just assumed that my intrusive thoughts were me. I didn‚Äôt understand that they were part of the symptoms caused by the chemical imbalance in my brain and not just me being simply fucked up and weird. 

So after learning more about this i ended up kinda ‚Äúdepersonalising‚Äù them, cause i no longer saw them as my feelings that I couldn‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ and in true ADHD form I accidentally made them into a Mind Goblin ???

Now he‚Äôs a special lil guy‚Ä¶ In my mind he looks kind of Furby like but he can be whatever you want him to, think of it like one of those videogame sim generators that you can change around as you like ( so you can‚Äôt get stuck with a scary looking one lol). And he just sits in a corner in my brain, in his full-proof see trough box and his thing is just saying really absurd shit for no reason sometimes.
Now it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs doing this to be evil per se, he just can‚Äôt help it and so he goes on his tirades, like the feral little demon that he is.

Now before we continue, no you don‚Äôt have to feed or cleanup after him lmao he‚Äôs a self sufficient mind goblin, there‚Äôs no responsibilities here.

He also wears a lil t-shirt that says ‚ÄúNaughty Intrusive Thoughts ‚Äú, it‚Äôs kinda humiliating but he lowkey deserves it‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt actually hate him or anything, he just lives there and says things but in reality he has absolutely no power over me. He can say whatever he wants but i decide how i respond to it, sometimes  depending on what he says i engage with him and explain things, other times i mock him a bit or just ignore him ‚Ä¶.depends on my mood 

And idk for some reason these really uncomfortable and distressing thoughts seem a bit less disruptive when they‚Äôre coming from a imaginary rabid furball inside a box.

I would like to note this happened a long time ago back in middle school. Its just something that has been gnawing at me for years. In fact, its one of the two big moments which I still think about.

I wouldn‚Äôt really call him ‚Äúevil‚Äù, cause I don‚Äôt know what demons he might have been fighting, but a guy, which we will call Sam, bullied me for years on and off from 3rd grade to 8th. Note that I said on and off, since the harassment wasn't always constant. Hell, during most of middle school he was actually friendly, and being native, I beleived he had really changed. When has haressing me, He would call me names, whip me with his gym pants, and do things that the school deemed ‚Äúnot a problem‚Äù. Eventually I got so bad that I got into a fight with him in the latter half of middleschool. He didn‚Äôt even fight back really. My memory of the fight is a bit hazy. He was my height and a bit chubbier than me, but still. The fight is a bit of the blur, i just remember pulling on his shirt and hitting him, but not with full strength. He bent over and I pulled his shirt off and after that, someone who worked at the school saw what was going on (we were fighting beside the track and field with a parking lot right next to it, in front of the school. She saw it pretty well). What‚Äôs funny is that was the third instance of that happening that period. People broke up 2 other ‚Äúfights‚Äù we had earlier that period. Wasn't anything big, just me pushing him a bit everytime he tried his shit. For someone of his caliber, I expected him to be smarter. This was 8th grade btw. I just saw him pissed, almost crying during the last fight, and after it. To this day I don‚Äôt exactly know what to think of it. He still bullied me after, and my parents made it very clear to not fight back since I would get in trouble with the school again. As a good kid I just accepted it, and suffered in silence for a while. I still think about him at times. Sometimes I think of day dreams where I beat him, kick him, and just turn his face into a messed, bloodied version. Visons of slamming the back of his head on concreate, stomping his head on the ground, gut punching, with full force this time. In a sense, It makes me feel good, poweful, but also sick, since that isn't me, and could get me in legal trouble. Other times I wished I had tried to reason with him and turned the other cheak sort to speak ""Jesus style"" (I think that kind of sound stupid but I kinda find it funny, if a bit sad) . I just ignored him. Or rather tried to ignore him. I suspected over the years that he might have been abused, since my dad remembers his mom having a limp, but that was years ago. I don't know, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but I also hate doing so, since I tend to let people get away with bullshit. Overall, I don‚Äôt know if this story fits this sub. Also my grammar is awful, might change shit in the morning.

My brain tells me that if I don't figure out a solution to the nihilistic thoughts that they will make me depressed for the rest of my life and I'll never be able to enjoy anything. It tells me that my old self is gone and can never come back.

I'm basically just asking if ERP works for these thoughts. My brain is telling me ""no"" because on a forum I was told that ""Nihilism is inescapable and that once you realize that nothing matters, you're doomed and you will never be happy again"" this just inflates fear.

I've been having thoughts of my family members (my mom, dad, and sister) getting hurt in car accidents or in typical scenarios at their place of work. I'm not sure how to describe it but it's like this fear in the back of my mind and sometimes for this reason I just can't handle news on the TV about road accidents and such and would cry almost everytine these sorts of accidents happen then pray for the victims.

I'm 17 but I've had this sort of anxiety since I was around 7, I think. My parents normally arrive home at around a specific time and I remember calling them before work to ask when they were coming home and around what time they'll arrive then checking again if they were home late. My grandparents would joke about it but it was pretty serious for me. I remember when they had dinner parties or late meetings and I couldn't get a hold of them on the phone I would call them 10+ times until I could reach them or until my other family members put a stop to it.

My mom's office is near our house and school and I thought it'd be better as I was closer to her (5 minutes away from home) but sometimes I hear the ambulance and will panic until I call her and she picks up. I really struggle with it and it consumes my mind half the time. I opened up to my parents about it and they said whatever happens, I'm going to have to accept it and left it at that. 

My parents recently took me to a psychiatrist and I was prescribed some antidepressants for unrelated reasons (not turning in work for the subject I'm good at &gt; my teacher saying I'm a perfectionist &gt; the teacher talking to my counselor and the counselor telling my parents I should get help) but when I brought this up with the psychiatrist she just dismissed it. We've only had a few sessions so far and I think she thinks I'm just a normal teenager anxious about schoolwork and graduating high school as she ignores this whole issue altogether despite me bringing it up all four times we met (she diagnosed me with anxiety and avoidant personality disorder). I would really appreciate it if any of you guys know how I should approach this topic or if anyone had experienced this or have any resources I could look into or any advice in overcoming this. 

FYI: I live in Asia and I think mental health is still a bit stigmatized here and anyone I ask in real life would probably tell me to focus on schoolwork instead of ""daydreaming"" about these scenarios.

I'd sincerely appreciate it if anyone can offer me advice or guide me to any online forum because it's been getting worse and I hope I can get it together soon because it interferes with my parent's time and is a huge inconvenience to everyone around me.",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,88361,public,self,Thoughts about family members getting hurt,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/rvr10p/thoughts_about_family_members_getting_hurt/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I didn't know where else to post. 

A week ago I (16M) was watching a video about some old video game... idk, i wasn't paying much attention to it since i just put it on as background noise to clean my room to. Then, the narrator of the video mentioned that in the game, a body had been dismembered. for some reason, that phrase was all it took to start a weeks worth of thoughts that are honestly HORRIBLE, IMMORAL, and against my religion. I was thinking ""What would it be like to cut off someone's limbs like that? They'd be helpless."" 

and now i just can't force the image out of my mind of me cutting off the arms and legs of a girl and uh, doing bad things to her. I just recently got back my sex drive after months of it being completely dead from sadness, and now the only thing i can get off to is this specific thought... It upsets me because i know its wrong. in the moment, sure, it seems hot, but then after i finish im left there thinking, holy shit, i said i wouldnt do this again, i said i was done with immoral thoughts... and i did it again. 

I know God is probably sad that I do this, think about this. Jesus literally commanded men to rip out their eyes if they have lustful thoughts over seeing a woman... if i dont stop this soon, i'll be in a world of pain in the afterlife. After I'm done with my lust and its been satisfied, i think of how this displeases Yahweh Elohim and cry. 

I hate lust. back when i was too sad to get it up, i said i wanted it back, but now? I hate it so much and i wish i could just never get horny. over anything. it impairs the ability to think... to see right and wrong. you think of doing things that would send you straight to hell. You think of killing people, torturing them, shooting them, but in real life, you'd never do that. free from the influence of my dick, i know right from wrong.

literally what the fuck am i supposed to do? I cant push the images from my mind. I can't. I enjoy it in the moment, but afterwards the guilt is immense.

I‚Äôm really worried right now and fed up. I‚Äôve had a bad time over Xmas with intrusive thoughts.

Unfortunately I have to stay away from meditation I was doing this forgiveness meditation where you forgive yourself and others and  it would clear bad memories from myself and other people who wronged me. I know it sounds like make belief and I sound like I‚Äôm mentally ill.

The thing is I believe this stuff works as I‚Äôve seen in my own life myself getting better emotionally but unfortunately what happened was I had to forgive myself and all the bad thoughts started flooding in and they got worse and I started to get really scared

There is this one word that apparently will heal you and others and I got so scared that I would try not to say this one word and if I did I would hear voices in my head saying horrible things about me and I would think it was people I knew or knew of me.

And I was devastated that I nearly took my own life the only thing that saved me was myself telling me to contact someone and then something telling me it was all in my head . The emotions I felt were so intense that I nearly had a breakdown.

I really wanted to continue with the healing mantra but I have to stop because I couldn‚Äôt stop the intrusive thoughts.

I‚Äôve been seeing a psychiatrist but it‚Äôs from the government like a free one but I have to wait weeks before I can speak to them. I contacted a therapist but still waiting for a reply.

I didn‚Äôt care about this until about 7 months ago and OCD latched onto this and tortured me the past 7 months. So many compulsions like reading ‚Äúwhether getting attracted to such things is wrong‚Äù from Reddit posts and many what if thoughts. 

Thoughts like: ‚Äúwhat if I do this when I‚Äôm older‚Äù

I literally spent the past 3-4 days reading posts on Reddit with the title ‚Äúis being attracted to 16/17 year olds wrong as a [insert ages like 20/21/26M]‚Äù. Noticed the comments were so divided with saying the thoughts of attraction were fine while others called OP a horrible person and a creep. I got so shook and couldn‚Äôt breathe from the anxiety from reading the comments. 

I couldn‚Äôt help it searching on Reddit about it. I got so scared and felt extremely shameful because I had these thoughts of attractions and masturbated to them. What if, I‚Äôm older and got still attracted and masturbated? What if I‚Äôm actually a horrible person?

Furthermore, I have ocd of confession where I literally confessed all of POCD thoughts to my mum and mum understood my POCD very well. I feel like confessing these thoughts too.

I feel so sick. It centered around my parents mostly and I feel disgusting. I had other themes but this one is by far the worst.

Long story short, it started with an intrusive image of doing something sexual with my dad, i freaked out and prayed it wouldn't affect my mum. Sadly it did.

So it went away, and if I and left it I'm sure it would've gone away. But stupid me has to always make it all worse. Normal people would've let it pass but for me it was the end of the world.

I was terrified that when I got one of my beloved mum, that I might've had a groinal response (a normal reaction but I didn't realise it). I would've left it. I should've. But I felt so terrified, that I kept bringing the images back into my head and focus on my down area to see if anything happened. It's sick and disgusting. But i was scared. How could I even be having these images? 

I was constantly 'aroused' when I woke up, probably by anxiety, because it felt uncomfortable, but i was so stupid. I was scared it was because of the thoughts so I thought I was living a nightmare. I didn't think that it was something I had everyday, I woke up like that a lot even without any thoughts. Why didn't I leave it?? I kept getting the image thoughts, and one time when I was in bed I got them, and I moved to the side wanting to go to sleep after ruminating the whole day, and I had a horrible sensation. 

I was petrified. Was that a sexual repsonse? A groinal? An orgasm? I didn't know since I've never experienced anything sexual. What the hell was it? I didn't know. It was really strong, like a clench but it wasn't pleasant at all. It was strong but not a nice feeling. And I was terrified because I thought, was it because of the thoughts I just had?? Or just because I had anxiety arousal and when I moved it caused it? What the hell?

So I did something stupid. I was so panicked, since I didn't know if the clench sensation was sexual (never felt it before) and I couldn't just go to sleep with the uncertainty of what it was. I should've been logical, it didn't feel nice, so it wasn't sexual. But i was half asleep, panicking and didn't make that connection. I thought, the only way to find out what a sexual sensation was, was by masturbation, because masturbation brings those things about, and then I'd be able to be at peace if I knew what to actually look out for. Then I'd be at peace and know it wasn't the same as the sensation I was getting from the thoughts. I thought it would be problem solved. So I did it (also I remembered it brings anxiety relief so I decided to do it for that too). Then I felt horrible because, isn't this acting on thoughts??

Does this count as acting on the thoughts? Did I just commit incest? People tell me no I didn't, but I feel disgusting. I feel sick and vile. While I didn't do it to the thoughts themselves, because that wasn't my intention at all, I would never do that because it's disgusting, I did it in relation to the whole situation in a way so doesn't that count?

Like the whole thing? Does this count as acting on the thoughts? I obviously wasn't thinking them (they popped in twice or so but I i immediately stopped because it would be disgusting to carry on to them, I could never consciously do that) but it was kind of related to the whole situation? I can't face my parents. I feel so awful. I feel like I ruined my beautiful relationship with them. I love them most and I feel like a monster. I did not think it through, it was the middle of the night, and I thought it would bring a solution, because I was scared, but I can't stop feeling like it means I acted on those nasty thoughts.

Depersonalization-derealization disorder is a highly distressing mental illness. The American Psychiatric Association classifies it as a dissociative disorder, a class of mental health conditions that disrupt memory, awareness, identity or perception. People who have depersonalization-derealization disorder feel disconnected from their mind or body (depersonalization) or their surroundings (derealization). This leads to the people who suffer from it to have chronic anxiety and depression, which inevitably disrupts every aspect of their lives.
Up to 75% of people experience at least one depersonalization/derealization episode in their lives, and approximately 2% meet the full criteria to classify it as a chronic disorder.

I'm sure some of you are familiar with insestious OCD. Few days ago, my brain wouldn't shut up to me about how it wants me to believe that im sexually attracted to one of my family members. And as I was trying to shut it up by idk... looking at pics of my gf and trying to convince myself they're completely unrelated and that I'm only attracted to her. It kept attacking me with thoughts of ""hey look, her arms look similar to your family, you only like her bcz of incest"" and so much more where that came from. But while I was trying hsrd to work this out and shut my brain up, I came across a picture that.. you know.. caused arousal. One thing lead to another other and i ended up meeting my gf and you can guess what happened next in the bedroom. 

Anyways, ever since then I can't stop thinking... what if the reason I got aroused was just my intrusive thoughts about my family member, and that when i saw that picture i was thinking of them. And now thst I went through with the arousal and did what I did with my gf... I've confirmed the thoughts and just... irreversible entangled any attraction to her with my family. What if I created an irreversible bond between them now in my stupid brain that will stay with me forever...

Now everytime i look at her or talk to her... it keep thinking... ""All your attraction to her is not caused by your family, you only like her bcz of your insestious thoughts. You're attracted to your family, you're into incest.""

It'd been 5 days of trying to shake this off

I'm scared I've completely ruined my emotions towards her bcz of this ""bond"" I've created by going through with the thoughts. Help please I can't take it. I dont feel like I can ever see her the same way again. I can't live like this  anymore. Pls someone help, and not by giving me false or untrue hope. Did i break my brain into merging my gf and familymember now? I HATE THIS I HATE IT.

And you're gonna tell me, ""since you hate it, you clearly didnt"" but what if i did, and im in constant denial, and im too scared to try and think it through because I'm scared its true.

So, I'm only a kid but I've started to have really intrusive thoughts doing anything sexual or thinking about anything sexual. 

I think the reason for this is because of my mum. I hate blaming shit on people but in this instance I'd say I'm very justified. After years of hating myself and being unstable and suicidal I decided to question whether all of it was really me and after seeing 3 therapists I've realised my mum is abusive, perhaps not intentionally but she is. 

And unfortunately part of it is the fact that she has no boundaries. While this sort of behaviour has stopped from 7-13 she has given me complete grief

She acted in a very sexual way and I'd argue sexually abused me to an extent or just very much overlapped her boundaries 


While shes dome plenty of other things I think these things amounts of intrusive thoughts on the daily but especially if I think or do anything sexual 

It's like all those things she used to say to me echo through my head constantly and it never stops. It like echoes and sounds all distance like it's a character in a film 

I know everyone is gonna tll me to go get therapy but I literally cany because I know if I told them all that shit about my mum they would 100% have to report it because I'm still technically a minor. I dont think my mums intention was that bad. Yes she did it on purpose but I dont think shes a pedo, but more just an extreme lack of boundaries.

But here it goes.

I developed horrible sexual intrusive thoughts this past week (been told I have OCD so it's a bit relieving but I still feel gross). It started with intrusive images of sexual acts with my dad and my mum, and while I could've dealt with that, I did something horrible.

So i kept imagining the images to check I didn't get the groinal response, and I did, and I still could've dealt with that. It's horrible, I can't believe I imagined those things on purpose, it's hard to deal with, but, I was terrified if I was actually aroused. I was so scared that what I felt was a sexual feeling I panicked. For some reason my mind said, if you felt anything down there it means you're aroused by the thoughts. So I kept checking myself every time the thoughts happened.

It's disgusting. The thoughts were there so often, and when I was in bed, I obviously had the 'groinal', I had it non stop to be honest, probably because of the intense anxiety, and when I moved to the side to go to sleep, I got a horrible sensation 'down there'. I panicked, thinking, was that a sexual thing? did I get that to the thoughts? This happened right before one thought appeared in my mind so I panicked. I didn't want to have any feeling down there to these thoughts, however I didn't know what 'sexual things' feel like so,

I decided to touch myself to find out what feeling aroused/sexual feelings actually feels like. Because I didn't know what it felt like. I've never actually been aroused that I know of. So I did that. So I would know, and would be able to tell afterwards.

Does this mean I touched myself to those thoughts? I feel so disgusting, I keep telling myself no I didn't, because your intention wasn't to do that TO those thoughts, it was to find out if what sexual things feel like so you will know, but I'm going crazy. But I did it to compare, which is technically doing that because of the thoughts right? I feel like an actual monster. Who in their right mind does this? I don't know anymore.

Does this mean I touched myself to those horrible thoughts?? Please please help, I am in a very desperate state. I can't deal with it. Later, when I did just touch myself just for anxiety relief, the thoughts did appear and I immediately stopped when they did, but continued after I redirected my thoughts, does that mean I touched myself to them too?

I can't believe I ruined my life like this. If only I didn't get the stupid idea to check, I would've been fine.

Okay so about a week ago, I got the weird thought about an entity wanting to delete all of my memories and thoughts, just because I missed an OC of mines' birthday, when all I was doing was rescheduling it so I won't forget it. The entity then convinced me that it was a DID alter and needed to ask people with DID about this problem.

 And this leads to the current situation about 2 nights ago, when I was talking to myself about how I may or may not have dissociative amnesia, and I had Instagram on while talking about this and the explore page at the time had refreshed.

Hi, 
So I have OCD (specifically an obsession with legality). I just need to get it off me so I can move on. Sorry if it‚Äôs long, lots of thoughts related to one thing.

Censoring words with food just in case. 

So recently my thoughts have been filled with this nonsense but it causes me panic. So, when I was a teen a few years ago, I looked at/ googled/followed a rabbit trail of links in the past of cartoon corn (2-4 times) and mainly fan fiction as a dumb teen. (Never lollipop /shots/ anything anime, that stuff freaked me out and made me upset. It was mainly deviant art I went on twice, and some tumblr r34 fanart people drew and posted with their fan fictions, or I saw something on Pinterest or Wattpad and tracked it to the source). 

That‚Äôs play a huge part of it. I am scared that I looked at something illegal as a teen. Like it‚Äôs so bothersome to me that I asked legal advice probably around 6-7 times and have an urge to ask again, if any of the stuff I did is illegal, they repeatedly say no. Like every time I asked, they said no, get therapy. No, call your doctor, that I‚Äôm absolutely absurd, or I need to relax. (A forum moderated by mainly cops and lawyers repeatedly told me no, mods deleted my posts over and over cause it wasn‚Äôt legal issues they said. ** it‚Äôs a reassurance and checking compulsion**

But again, I fear I have something unwanted, illegal, or that I‚Äôm in possession of something or that someone is going to look into everything I‚Äôve ever done. The answer is always no, but It bothers me about it cause again, legal obsession. *Even though I always report illegal things immediately and have tons of links to reporting sites saved, like fbi and stuff.* it‚Äôs completely irrational. 

I did all this stuff on my phone. I jus
T got a new one. But,  lI gave that phone to my dad to use because he has a bad battery on his phone and we are going to visit Australia in a few years. (travel is one of my biggest wishes and I want to see the world with my family).  So my intrusive thoughts are I‚Äôm afraid of being in possession of something and now I gave it to him, even though it was erased and factory reset, wiped (and I looked at that stuff years ago) and he‚Äôs taking it to the tech shop to be fixed and set up, so he‚Äôs using it. 

Now I‚Äôm afraid if we ever travel, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve done something illegal (I haven‚Äôt repeatedly told I haven‚Äôt by the people on legal advice) and because I gave that phone to him and I had that phone as a teen and mainly used it,  I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll get arrested and I‚Äôve ruined his life and endangered my family. And it‚Äôll be my fault. (Doesn‚Äôt matter who got the phone, if I traded it in, I‚Äôd worry the same either way, but I got triggered by those customs agents tv shows, it freaked me out that they can search your body, devices, everything if they want without anything like a warrant, they can just look at it, they just need to be suspicious. ) **Because I really love my parents and family, my morals, and just my dreams of the future, OCD targets it because i value it.** So it really triggered me bad *[watched that one xqc stream and now it‚Äôs an obsession]* It made me fear international travel.

At the start of the year I was attacked by a dog, had PTSD and then caught the unnamed disease which tipped me over the edge. Have been seeing a therapist since and made great leaps. Work is going well, was happy to return after lockdown. 
Anyway, went on vacation 3 weeks ago, the build up was extremely stressful, from trying to avoid catching covid beforehand to driving through the snow to the airport.
Landed in the country I‚Äôve been to at least 10 times and was happy to be there, then boom wake up day 2 and I have a UTI. Went and got antibiotics before it got worse and they kicked me into a pit I am now struggling to get out of. First day of antibiotics I woke up from a dream that I was jumping off the balcony, I then had a horrific panic attack, haven‚Äôt had a panic attack in &amp; months. For 2 days afterwards I was getting extreme vertigo walking upto the room and my legs had turned to jelly. Felt like I was battling with my mind to not jump off the balcony. Eventually was moved to a ground floor room which helped. 
As antibiotic thoughts continued I stopped them and went to a doctor who prescribed me a different brand. He also gave me diazepam after I told him about the thoughts. I‚Äôve never taken any anxiety meds so was keen to avoid having to take them.
Flash forwards 3 days, UTI had gone but my mind was suffocating me. Suicidal thoughts all day and I have never had them before. I can‚Äôt grasp the feeling. I returned home 3 days ago and I can‚Äôt settle at home. It feels like I can‚Äôt look forward to anything and I‚Äôm now wondering if I will ever feel happy again, questioning life in general and wondering if I‚Äôve ever actually been happy. 
I have got through so much this year I just don‚Äôt understand where the thoughts have come from and how I can get through it.

At some point around that time I was in a really bad state. I was experimenting with thoughts that I shouldn't. About two years later I began to have my first visions. They included the end of the universe, of me being designed once again, using my thoughts as a ""reason"", and advanced technology resistant to heatdeath, to rebuild me from nothing and place me in a pocket universe where I would be tortured eternally. I escape only to be tracked for infinity, flying through a really small donut-shaped universe in a ship that can just barely outrun the figure who tortures me. I don't know who that figure is, but I believe they went to high school with me.

Fastforward, I asked lucifer for infinite knowledge because I wanted to become immortal and all powerful. Went REALLY badly. My brain couldn't contain the information so I became overloaded and started to decay alive. I died, being a walking corpse, bones and shit were just decaying as I was animtaed but not living.

I asked God for help (I was an atheist). It worked (I am not proletyzing anyone here, you have your own beliefs if you want). I now feel obligated and connected to God because he is the reason I was able to survive this encounter, whether he is fictive or perhaps something that exists. I owe him, in my mind or outside of it. In return, I follow the bible loosely and consider myself a Christian but with great limitations because I believe the fallability of the bible as it has been translated too many times.

Ultimately, I got on medication but no matter what these intrusive thoughts continue. Now, my dreams are predicting future encounters with perfect accuracy. It is a family trait. It is amplified in my mental state, because I can be influenced by people who were like me in the past. I am not a genius but the opposite, I cannot systemize, I can produce something from nothing, abstraction rather than organization. So in a sense, what is seen as ""Madness"" is really the fundamental process to everything humanity sees in the world.

I'm pretty fucked up but I know it. I just don't know the solution, I can't ""see"" what's happening I can only sense it. I have so many intrusive thoughts, they're out of my control. I just know to stay in one spot, if I leave I will end up on another continent, lacking in funds and probably with nothing but the clothes on my back as everything will be stolen.

And if I do get mad it goes away. But this time was very different. I have slowly been changing a lot of aspects of my life. And I have reached job wise, personal wise a happiness I wanted to obtain. I had bad experiences in the past with low self-esteem, keeping friends and not ending UN-healthy friendships because of the low self esteem or just not knowing how to go about it. I became angered by things done in the past to me, particularly a friendship that ended poorly will call this friend Rebecca. This Rebecca would make remarks about my sexuality and they compared me to my mother, saying I would never be as good as her and wondered how Rebecca could keep my mother in her life and not me. This statement Rebecca made during an argument. And I never forgot it, it made me resent my mother in some way. They stopped speaking with me and nobody ever said if the friendship was over or not. I felt as if, if I am not like how people want me to be, then I am not a good person. But Rebecca continued talking to my mom sending heart emojis and trying to spend time with them. It made me feel angered and as if I am a piece of shit. I got into a major argument with my mother. I blocked Rebecca's number on my moms phone. Then found out Rebecca used a different number to contact my mother and blocked that number. Since that experience I become paranoid on occasion Rebecca will show up at my house and I will not know about it.   


Recently I became filled with anger towards my mom even fantasized hurting someone or her because of how angry I felt about the situation. I was so angry I felt no emotion. I expressed to my mother in a mean way how angry I was at her. Even though I know she was just being caring with this person. I feel very bad about feeling that way and was very honest about it with my mother. 

Does this anger make me a evil person? I feel so paranoid and filled with guilt that I felt this anger that I still have the intrusive thoughts and overthink my overthinking about my own emotions.

Hope you are safe and alright.

Long story short. I've been cheated on in my last relationship (ended about 5 years ago) and it completely crushed my selfsteem and gave me loads of insecurities. 

It was hard, but thanks to therapy and support I got over it and I started to meet new people. I'm currently in a new relationship (1,5 year) and she is amazing with me. We talked about our past, and we have experienced to be cheated on in our last relationship, so we understand each other very well.

This is the issue. A few months ago, I asked her about a guy she never told me about but I saw in her phone when notifications pop up a few times. She told me that he was a guy who was flirting with her, but she was giving him the runaround for him to stop. I didn't feel comfortable with that and I asked her to stop talking to him. She did, but she got angry with me for thinking she was flirting with someone. The truth is that she was not telling him to stop, until I told her. After some days, she told me that it was an awful way to making someone stop flirting and she was sorry about that.

The case is, the situation gave me ""Vietnam flashbacks"". I started to feeling kinda insecure and started to have selfsteem problems again. I told her this, she told me she didn't understand why I was feeling like that, but she was going to be with me. 

This last month was great in terms of the relationship, but I'm still struggling with some intrusive thoughts of she cheating on me, like my last relationship. F.e, she went out with a friend a few hours ago and I was kinda nervous. I'm not a controlling or toxic guy, I don't expect her to stop going out at night, to stop talking to her male friends or to know what is she doing 24/7; absolutely not.

I totally trust her and want to be with her, but I'm just losing the battle about managing this thoughts again. I try what I learnt in therapy, but it is not working. Any advice I get here would be great.

I can't live with the possibility, I'd rather kill myself. I ALWAYS get new obsessions/ or they just morph into worse ones, when I feel happy. I had just gotten out of a 2 month 'episode' of intense distress and anxiety because of them, and BAM. This happens. It was so random too, I've never even considered the possibility of it.

I get thoughts as images so it's even more disturbing because it feels like I imagine them on purpose ( I don't even know anymore, I just know I want them gone and I cry a lot because of this problem I have with disgusting obsessive thoughts ). 

After freaking out about what if I'm a sadist, I even imagined it on purpose to 'check' myself and it felt like I do enjoy them, but I can't tell the difference between excitement and anxiety because it feels the same (like a pressure/weight in the chest and heart beat gets stronger) and it's making me feel insane, how do I know?? 

I don't want to enjoy disturbing thoughts like these, I don't want to be messed up. Does this mean I have no empathy??? Then that would also make me a sociopath right??? I can't be them I just can't but what if I'm in denial?? What if I'm lying to everyone because I can't accept that I am this person? Am I really overthinking this or am I just messed in the head? My parents say I'm, if anything, overly empathetic but I find it hard to believe because of these new obsessions. I don't know I'm so lost, any help would be appreciated.",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,87925,public,self,Do these count as intrusive thoughts or am I just discovering that I'm an evil person and I'm in denial because I can't accept the fact I'm messed up?

I tried medication, I tried therapy with several different theorists back in the day and it just didn't help long term. This year has been awful for me looking back on it. My childhood piano teacher, a dear friend I've know since I was 10, passed away in the Spring. A childhood acquaintance I had growing up was randomly murdered earlier this year too and a friend of mine (roughly same age as me (M25) )  lost his father recently this winter, who passed away not long after Thanksgiving. 

Earlier tonight I just decided to dive into some of the horrible people and horrible things that my OCD keeps pestering my mind with (serial killers, genocide, murder) which seem to ask me every day in my mind ""oh don't you think this is fascinating?"" or ""you don't have any emotional sympathy to these things- you're apathetic to ALL of it.""

No matter how many times I tell this stuff to shut up, and try and spend my time thinking about other things, I just can't beat it. I always have been a very empathetic, sensitive person, so these constant accusations of my character in my mind along with the mental prodding for me to ""check out"" the evils of horrible people and ""how they got away with it"" just has gotten to me. I sometimes will get in such a panic attack like earlier tonight that the only thing I can think about is the dream I have to end it all. 

There's so much that's wrong with me (depression, hopelessness, self hate, confusion) that I really dream everyday and certainly in episodes like tonight of just killing myself. I don't even believe anymore that I'm a good person! I won't kill myself because I don't want to put that on my family, but by God, if it wasn't for them, I'd do it in a heartbeat. 

I'm so lost for words. My childhood acquaintance who was murdered earlier this year- there are youtube videos about his death uploaded by his county's news channel and shockingly there are such nasty comments of disrespect and jeering toward him, a victim of murder, that I just wanted to smash my computer into a million pieces out of rage and helplessness. He was a farmer for Christ's sake. Someone who lived a quiet life. We both had that in common- that was our childhoods growing up on farms. 

I just don't have an outlet to cry out to (outside of this reddit community I guess) because my mother will cry if I reach out to her with this stuff and my father will go into a tailspin of worrying about me and trying to get me a therapists where I live if I tell him (I happen to live 9 hours away from them in a different state.) 

I just don't think there's any point in trying to unload any of my pain/troubles on anyone around me anymore because I see how futile it is. By the way, I am not on any medication at this time. I haven't taken meds prescribed by therapists in years, since discussing it with my last one and weaning myself off of them. I just didn't see them having an effect on me.",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,87930,public,self,"I literally have no clue what to do!

Later, I wiped down the strap with a Lysol wipe. I cannot remember if I used the same wipe or another one (I really hope I used another) to wipe down the bottom of my bag, then.

I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with anything yet because my psychologist doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs more like OCD or generalized anxiety. All I know is that what I‚Äôm experiencing is intrusive thoughts.

I get thoughts like that talking to men or male presenting people means I wanna have sex with them, or that I‚Äôm in love with them. Sometimes I imagine sex with them/get mental images and I don‚Äôt like it. 

It‚Äôs not all the time tho, and it doesn‚Äôt last for hours on end or anything and I don‚Äôt act out compulsions for hours either. I also get checking thoughts. Especially when I‚Äôm out of the house. I went to the beach with my boyfriend the other day and had to keep checking things were in my bag. I had to do it myself and I did ask him if he could check for me at one point cuz he was holding my bag but that wasn‚Äôt enough and I had to do it myself. I have to take it out my bag and put it back in, I can‚Äôt just see it in there and be fine. But it‚Äôs not crazy it‚Äôs just I feel anxious and I need to check so I check.

Being nurodiverse is genetic in my family(been confirmed by doctors that it is genetic) and almost everyone on my mums side has something like adhd or ASD. But I worry that it‚Äôs just anxiety cuz I get anxious over other things too and I always have ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù in my head.

But I feel like because it‚Äôs not serious nothing is wrong with me and it‚Äôs all in my head and I‚Äôm faking everything. Which is another intrusive thought I regularly get, that I‚Äôm faking everything. 

And my compulsions aren‚Äôt usually that bad. With the faking one I get really distressed and when people ask if I‚Äôm ok I kinda convince myself I‚Äôm ok and I just repeat over and over again ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok‚Äù and if people keep asking I get angry and can shout that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me and it‚Äôs all in my head. With the sexual and romantic thought I can move away from people and not talk to them or I can‚Äôt ask teachers for help or to go to the bathroom cuz of the thoughts. With checking the compulsions are pretty obvious, I check. Often it‚Äôs worse on public transport tho as I‚Äôll check multiple times and still feel anxious after leaving the transport and have to check over and over again when I get off.

We're currently recruiting for a trial that compares two online self-help programs (based on evidence-based face-to-face therapies) in their ability to improve obsessions/compulsions, anxiety, depression and quality of life.

We are looking for volunteers with intrusive thoughts and/or compulsions to participate in the 6-week program to learn skills to manage symptoms. No diagnosis is required and we welcome people in all stages of their recovery:) We hope the results can tell us more about the processes that drive intrusive thoughts and compulsions and find specific intervention targets.

There was already a huge hole in my screen, I‚Äôm guessing from the weather over the years or just normal tear since moving in the house about 10 years prior. But the window itself was intact and fully operable. Well, he claimed my friend made the hole larger than it was although I knew nothing had changed about the hole. He came into my room yelling and grabbing me by my shirt, shaking me. Then he slapped me. Unfortunately I was standing between my closet door and a wooden dresser and when he slapped me, all I remember is knocking my head on the dresser then waking up on the floor to him screaming at ‚Äúmy dumb ass‚Äù to stand up. I‚Äôm not sure how long I was out for but I feel like once I opened my eyes, it took at least 5 seconds for me to even understand where I was, and at least another 5 seconds to comprehend what my dad was saying. 

That night I just laid in my bed kind of numb. Not crying or anything, not upset because it didn‚Äôt phase me anymore, just numb. At the time before I knew what I know now, I figured going to jail wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. I spent 2 days thinking of this detailed plan (that I realize now was stupid) all to take a knife from the kitchen and be able to hide it in my room without my dad or stepmom noticing, I managed to pack some clothes and a phone I‚Äôd been hiding and put it away in the back of my closet. I can‚Äôt remember where I was planning to run to now that I think about it but I had the major part down.

That second night, I had gotten the knife into my room and managed to stay awake until my dad went to bed. I knew to wait at least 2 hours after they had fallen asleep to try anything so once they went to bed, I sat by my door and just counted down. After the 2 hour mark hit, I stood up with the knife in my hand and my heart just started pounding. I slowly turned my doorknob and walked out my room as if I were walking to the bathroom. I figured if they were still awake, they would question if I‚Äôd walked straight to their door. So I walked across the hall to the bathroom and listened for my dad snoring, movements of the sheets, stuff like that. I ‚Äúused the bathroom‚Äù and waited for the toilet to stop flushing so I could put my ear up to the wall to hear if they were still snoring. They were. 

I walked out the bathroom and crawled into their bedroom to my dad‚Äôs side of the bed, since their backs were both facing that way. If they woke up, I could easily duck down and crawl out. I stood up over my dad with the knife behind me, thought about exactly what I would do and then I just froze. I don‚Äôt know why but I just couldn‚Äôt get my brain to tell my hands to do it. It‚Äôs crazy trying to explain it but it‚Äôs like my mind wanted to do it but my hands wouldn‚Äôt move. I snuck out the room and went to the kitchen, put the knife back and went to bed. The next day I erased it out of my mind and every once in a while I still think about it. Then I put it back into the pit of my mind again. My dad doesn‚Äôt know and we have a very shitty relationship to this day due to his abuse and narcissistic personality. I love him because he‚Äôs my dad but he cannot be apart of my life. He and my stepmom divorced and I haven‚Äôt seen her in years.

My building has tons of code violations and most people didn‚Äôt even know if the alarms worked since there were signs warning residents about it. In my entire 33 years of life thus far, I‚Äôve only experienced fire drills, burnt popcorn and run of the mill false alarms. I wasn‚Äôt worried at all and just chilled in my room thinking it was accidentally triggered by someone working on the building. The alarms kept going blaring and I saw fire trucks outside which heightened my anxiety slightly. I still  thought they were probably just there to disable the alarm. I decided to check the front door of my condo and immediately smelled a super strong smell. It reeked of burning plastic. I am not positive but thought I could also psychically see smoke. That‚Äôs when I panicked. I hurried to close my bedroom door so I could contain the cats since they were relaxing in there. I immediately grabbed a carrier from my front hall closet. I felt like I didn‚Äôt have time to fuss with two separate ones. I was literally shaking trying to put them in the carrier but they didn‚Äôt seem to fight me. They usually whine and cry but they were silent for some reason. I grabbed them, my keys and my phone and went downstairs. People weren‚Äôt concerned in the slightest. I got the gossip that the 4th floor apartment had an insulation fire. I was the one weirdo holding a twenty pound carrier of cats while others stood by visibly annoyed at the inconvenience. A lady in the building was very interested in my cats and said she had two as well. She said if things got bad she would go and grab them since she lived on the first floor. I felt silly but I was fearful that if the fire got out of control, I wouldn‚Äôt able to grab them and that regret would haunt me. The fire was put out and had no effect on my floor. The smell however, gave me migraines for hours. I thought this was the end of this traumatic event (traumatic to me) but over the next days to weeks. I started having instructive thoughts that gave me panic attacks and left me in extreme distress. I googled (I know, not the best thing to do)and found out that all my symptoms were in line with something called ‚Äúharm ocd‚Äù I was confused but I did have ocd behaviors as a kid that I didn‚Äôt realize was OCD until I was older. When I was younger my parents told me it was silly that I would have do touch things to feel safe. I agreed with that and it seemed to disappear until 20+ years later. Do you think the potential fire was the cause of this resurgence? I was also getting off different meds since my primary care would no longer keep prescribing gabapentin and zanaflex I‚Äôm curious to figure out why I went through a mental breakdown so suddenly. I have this fear I‚Äôll blackout and kill my cats in my sleep. I LOVE my cats and they mean the world to me. 

I‚Äôm not looking for ‚Äúreassurance‚Äù cause from what I researched I know that is a bandaid for the problem rather than a solution. I‚Äôm just curious about why it came on so suddenly and I‚Äôd love to hear other people‚Äôs stories.

I‚Äôm talking to my therapist tomorrow. She knows about my panic I had already and we decided to have a session about it. I‚Äôm already diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ADD.

I am so, so sorry for writing this out. I dont recommend anybody reading this, at all, but i must write it out in painful detail. I must get it off my chest.*

**What if you did something incredibely embarassing or sad or terrible right now?**

Like, something so embarassing it would be straight up sad. Imagine in full detail how embarassing it would be to live with the consequences. Something so embarassing that people don't just forget, but they get second hand embarassement so strong it grows on them, as if merely witnessing the event had the effect of participating in it. What if you did things like that constantly? 

How about this, maybe not something so embarassing, but just sad? What if each time your parents asked you to come with them to visit your family member's grave you said ""no"", because you prioritized watching youtube videos instead? Not with malitious intent, but because you were incapable of realizing the weight of a death in the family, and you were so oblivious, immature and pure, that you simply couldn't comprehend such matters. What if you were obese and unhealthy? What if you only drank soda and ate way too much sweet food. You pretty much did that when you were really young, which is understandable, but what if you never stopped? What if your parents kept buying it, knowing full well how unhealthy it is. Imagine how unhappy they would be with their life, as their son keeps getting unhealthier, is chronically online and their lives slowly pass monotonously by.

What if you jumped out of the window? Its half a meter away from you to your left, and you are 6 stories up. You are one handle-bar twist and jump away from doing it. Imagine if you just left no message, last words, reason, nothing. Imagine if you completely ruined the lives of your family right now for absolutely no reason, as you fall to your death. What would be going through your mind? Why would you do it in the first place? Imagine your aspirations, goals, achievements, relationships, bonds, ideas, hobbies, music tastes, future plans, things you are excited about, things that bring you happiness and comfort, headcanons, stories, everything, plummet onto the pavement for absolutely no reason. Imagine that whole immaturity scenario again. What if you were really young and didn't understand what you were doing, and were to regret it extremely badly once you were actually falling to your death? What if you were that kid, watching some minecraft videos on your greasy old Lenovo, eating lays chips, and you fell out of your window? Imagine screaming in agony as your young undeveloped mind refuses to accept your fate, and your entire body is filled with adrenaline as you fall for those excruciating couple of seconds, impacting the ground and diving head-first into an eternity  of nothingness. Imagine your father coming home at 5 pm, only to find out that his son jumped out of the window, with the reason seemingly only beeing sheer mindless carelessness.

What if you were a single father, whose child had major depressive disorder from birth that was permanent? Imagine being a father with a 4 year old that is physically incapable of feeling happiness, going through the desaturated colorless fog of life, whilst you were completely oblivious to his condition. What if you were a father that would be the total opposite? You would be a quiet optimistic person going through a below-average boring suburban life, only living with your son, and you would try to cheer up your son on a daily basis, being only met with a sympathetic poker face and a sigh. You might think to yourself that your son is simply a bit on the down-low, whatever it is its natural. As children often feel immortal through naive inexperience, you feel as though your son is perfect and that nothing is wrong with him anyways. Imagine one day coming home, maybe a couple days away from his 6th birthday, or maybe, a couple days away from christmas, and smelling a terrible odour from somewhere in the house. Imagine following the smell, only to find your son had hanged himself. How would you feel, as you quickly removed the knot and brought the cold pale corpse on the ground, only to find no pulse? CPR is unsuccessful and the paramedics pronounce him dead on the scene. On a scale of 0 to 10, how would you rank the utter hopeless terror and sheer indescribable agony youd feel in that moment? That moment that dragged on forever, that moment that engulfed you, folded your stomach into a knot, made your heart burst, chewed you with its terrible teeth and spat you out in your own vomit and tears. How would you describe your life leading away from that moment? That life that is forever now hopeless, empty, devoid of all that is meaningful or fun or- Thanks for taking the time of your day to fill out our survey! Your feedback is valuable to our company.

**Would you be willing to answer some questions about your experiences?**

Adults who have experience of living with Pure O (sometimes referred to as primarily obsessional OCD/pure obsessional OCD/ obsessions without visible compulsions) are invited to take part in an anonymous online survey for a doctoral research project.

The survey questions will be open-ended and ask you about what it is like to live with pure O including topics such as your friendships and relationships and what it has been like to seek support (if you have).

Research participants often report that they enjoy taking part in research studies and sharing their experiences. It is hoped that you will value contributing to developing understandings of an important psychological issue.

***To Take Part in this Study, Participants Need to:***

* Either self-define as having Pure O or have a diagnosis of OCD that manifests as obsessions without clearly visible compulsions
* Be 18 or over
* Be willing to take part.

**Please use the following link to access the survey and participate:** [https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_cvxyi4pVvbvDfBH](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cvxyi4pVvbvDfBH)",True,False,False,intrusivethoughts,t5_2tqd6,87876,public,self,Participants Needed for Research Study on ‚ÄòPure O‚Äô OCD,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/razmst/participants_needed_for_research_study_on_pure_o/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a 23 year-old man with Asperger's Syndrome, who's worrying about the following intrusive pure-'O' thought:

In July 2020, I was on Tumblr and happened to come across a young woman's blog, where some men had asked sexual questions; she responded directly and (as I remember) in a way that showed comfortableness - not unhappiness or anything negative.

Thinking it would be okay to ask a question, I then proceeded to ask a (very tame) one, before falling asleep. I'm certain that had she said anything negative, I would not have said anything, out of fear of crossing a stated boundary.

After waking up excitedly and finding out that my 'Ask' had not been answered, I moved on with my day, etc. Now, unsurprisingly, I'm doubting whether or not she was comfortable with the other men, and whether or not I sexually harassed her.

Specifically, the doubt has me worrying over this simple interaction even more so due to having Asperger's Syndrome, and so the OCD will make me think, ''Well, maybe you misunderstood her potentially sarcastic reply?!'', and I feebly retort, ''Well, ya' got me there, buddy!''.

''What if she only responded in a non-uncomfortable way because she felt socially-conditioned to do so as a woman?!'', is what my brain has thrown at me, and it's ridiculously frustrating.

Through my 'self-therapy' sessions, I've remembered how I'd originally reflected on this a few months later and thought, ''She was okay with it'', and given that the memory was still at the time quite fresh, I didn't doubt my reflection, and that was the end of it.

Well, a huge fear of mine, and a reoccurring intrusive thought of mine is losing all of my limbs. I know this is a reality for some people, but regardless of that, it's something that popped into my head as a child. ""What if that happened to me?"" I don't know in what scenario that would happen, but I was terrified of it. When I got a little older I ran across a YouTuber who had gotten bacterial meningitis and had to have her limbs amputated. 

After viewing her content, and although she was extremely inspiring and funny, I became so worried about getting this that I rarely wanted to leave my home anymore and I had to stop viewing her content, which I typically enjoyed because of her humor, but the intrusive thoughts would ruin it for me. It didn't make sense and I knew that. 

Well, today, as I was scrolling through TikTok, someone posted a clip of a movie or a show where a woman had her limbs amputated unwillingly. It didn't show gore or anything, it was the aftermath. There were in a house with another woman, so it's safe to assume she was being held there against her will. And she woke up in a wheelchair with no arms and legs. 

It made my skin crawl, it made me feel nauseous, and it's all I've been able to think about today. I've tried watching other videos, YouTube, movies, grocery shopping, cooking, washing my hair, cleaning my house. It keeps just... rerunning in my head. I can't stop thinking about it. And when the woman screamed, obviously it was a movie, but it was a blood curdling scream. The helplessness that person had to have felt if that ever has happened shakes me to my core. 

I just can't stop thinking about it.

**Everything stated is merely thoughts, nothing has ever been acted on nor ever will be**

TW:will involve pedophilia,sa,sh,etc.


I posted in another subreddit about this same issue, I hope I can find some sort of relief here. When I was younger I attended a private Catholic school. Abstinence, and overall morality has always been taught to me. So I always thought it was off that I had such graphic and vulgar thoughts. I remember sitting in mass, thinking off about how I wish I could stop time and strip everyone down naked. Have people perform intercourse on the church alter etc. This started in elementary school. When I got a bit older, 5th grade or so- I discovered pornography. Homosexual pornography to be exact lol. From that point forward I've wanted every person I've seen walk past me or just on the road to perform sexual acts. I wanted to watch more than participate. If I did participate I've always had fantasies of it being by force. Practically wanting to be raped. Skip forward to 6th grade when I discovered chat rooms and the online world. Talking to perverted old men, listening to them want my prepubescent body. It all made me so excited, to be wanted, to be glorified by someone older. So often I gave in, and so often I thought to myself I wanted to do the same. For so long I have had long deep thoughts of wanting to rape or murder someone, something, anything really. Necrophilia, beastiality, pedophilia even- all of it goes through me mind. All my life I have never felt remorse for it though, not once have I regretted my fantasies and day dreams. Yet still though I beg for help, for someone to listen. It's sort of like how serial killers love for people to know their brilliant ways of murder. I want the public to know how horrible of a person I am. I want to feel bad, or feel something. I reach out now, just to see if someone has a label for this. For why I am like this.
